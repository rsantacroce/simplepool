# Validate the pps-classic coinbase shape end-to-end:
#
#   1. Bootstrap the regtest L1: generate ~150 blocks to a stock P2WPKH
#      address so we have spendable coins and a sane chain height.
#   2. Activate sidechain #9 (Thunder) via the enforcer's BIP300
#      propose/ack flow. The coinbase no longer carries a deposit, but an
#      active sidechain means the GBT template still carries the BIP301
#      commitment outputs the coinbase builder must preserve.
#   3. Configure simplepool in pool_mode=pps-classic, pointed at the
#      enforcer's getblocktemplate endpoint (127.0.0.1:18444).
#   4. Connect a stratum miner (here: cpuminer-style via Python) for a
#      few seconds — we just need it to mine ONE block. Regtest difficulty
#      is trivially low.
#   5. Read the new tip's coinbase tx and assert:
#        - the spendable output pays pool_btc_address
#        - the operator BTC fee output is present at fee_bps
#        - no OP_DRIVECHAIN output is emitted (pool_mode=pps is gone)
#
# Moving the accumulated BTC into Thunder is a separate, operator-driven
# step — see CLASSIC_PAYOUTS.md.
#
# This script is intentionally a "guided runbook" — each step prints
# clearly so a human can read the output and intervene.
