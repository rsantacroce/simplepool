/* Hard-failure health checks.
 *
 * Every problem this pool has hit was found by someone running a query, never
 * by being told. These are the conditions that mean money or data is already
 * wrong, evaluated on every page load and surfaced as a banner.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: degradation signals (BMM capture, settlement
 * latency, backlog size, reserve headroom). They are worth watching but they
 * fluctuate, and a banner that is sometimes red for a slow afternoon is a
 * banner nobody reads. Everything below is binary and actionable.
 *
 * Each check is independent and self-contained: a check that throws because
 * its table predates the current schema reports `unavailable` rather than
 * taking the page down with it.
 *
 * Evaluated on a timer, not per request. better-sqlite3 is synchronous, and
 * the duplicate-hash check measured 2.0s against 337k shares — running that on
 * the request path with a 15s auto-refresh would stall the whole dashboard.
 * The timer keeps full-history coverage (a windowed check would go green on a
 * duplicate from two days ago that nobody noticed) while page loads only read
 * the last snapshot. See startHealthMonitor / currentHealth.
