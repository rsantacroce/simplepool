 *      inputs recorded beside it and the configured fee. Catches a rate that
 *      was applied consistently but derived wrongly, which check 1 cannot
 *      see.
 *
 *   3. linkage — every rate a share was credited at must appear in the log,

 *      and are counted as unverifiable, not as failures.
