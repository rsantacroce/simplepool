# simplepool dashboard

A small read-only Node.js dashboard for the [simplepool](../) solo-mining
stratum server (the one with direct miner payouts + a small operator
fee). It opens a **snapshot** of the proxy's SQLite database in
read-only WAL mode and serves a public web page with hashrate, a worker
leaderboard, recent blocks, a historical "blocks found by the pool"
page, and a per-worker drilldown.

Each worker row in the leaderboard is a `<bitcoin_address>.<rig_label>`
pair (stratum username convention); the `workers.payout_address` column
lets future views roll up multiple rigs per address. The historical
blocks panel at `/blocks` reads `blocks_found` and shows finder,
payout address, on-chain reward, and operator fee for every block the
pool has ever solved.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- The `simplepool` binary writing to a SQLite file (default `../data/shares.db`)
- A periodic snapshot at `../data/shares.snapshot.db` produced via
  `sqlite3 shares.db ".backup shares.snapshot.db"` on a cron — see the
  proxy [README](../README.md#database--dashboard-snapshot).

The dashboard opens the snapshot **read-only**. SQLite's online backup is
atomic, so the snapshot is always a consistent view of the live DB and the
proxy is never blocked by dashboard queries. It is safe to point multiple
dashboard instances at the same snapshot file.

## Install

```
cd simplepool/dashboard
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env if your DB path or port differs
```

## Run

```
npm start          # production
npm run dev        # auto-restart on file change
```

Defaults: `PORT=8081`, `DASHBOARD_BIND=127.0.0.1` (set `0.0.0.0` to serve it
without a reverse proxy), `PROXY_DB_PATH=../data/shares.snapshot.db`.

If the snapshot file doesn't exist yet, the dashboard starts anyway and
displays "no data yet" until the first `.backup` produces it. You can also
point `PROXY_DB_PATH` at the live `shares.db` if you don't want to run a
snapshot cron — SQLite's WAL mode makes that safe too, just less isolated.

| `/api/node`           | Mainchain tip and the network difficulty behind it      |
| `/api/worker/:name`   | JSON                                                    |
| `/api/blocks`         | JSON paginated, `?limit=N&before=<ts>` (default 50)     |
| `/api/versions`       | Build provenance of every component (see below)         |
| `/api/status`         | Everything at once: pool, node, health, versions        |
| `/healthz`            | `{ ok: true, db_ready: bool }`                          |
| `/health`             | Full hard-failure detail; 503 when a check is failing   |
| `/slipstream`         | Slipstream fees and recent txs (only with `SLIPSTREAM_API_URL`) |

`/api/status` is the one URL to poll if you want a single document: pool
totals and hashrate, mainchain tip, the health checks, and which commit of
each component is running. It always returns 200 — it is a report, and a
report that a check is failing was still produced successfully. Watch
`health.ok` for the condition and `/health` for a status code to alert on.

## Slipstream

Set `SLIPSTREAM_API_URL` (where this process reaches the [slipstream
service](../slipstream/README.md), e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8124`) and the
public nav gains a **Slipstream** page: the minimum submission rate, the
current mineable rate, how to submit, and each recent tx with where it
stands. `PUBLIC_SLIPSTREAM_URL` is the address shown to submitters.

The page reads the service's API, never `slipstream.db`, so the service stays
the only owner of its schema; if it is down, the page says so and the rest of
the dashboard is unaffected.

## Network difficulty

The node-tip card on `/` — and `/api/node` — report the chain's current
difficulty next to its height. It answers the question every other number on
the page depends on: what a share is worth under PPS, how often this pool
should expect a block, and whether a listener's promised `min_diff` is above
the chain at all.

It does **not** come from `node_status`. That table is the bitcoind tip poll
and carries no target. It comes from `pool_meta.network_difficulty`, which the
proxy rewrites from every block template it builds a job from
(`refresh_pps_rate()` in `src/main.c` derives it from the template's
target/bits) — the same row the PPS rate and the health checks read, so there
is one difficulty on this dashboard rather than two that can disagree.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- It carries **its own timestamp**, separate from the tip's. The tip poll and
  the template feed are different sources and go stale independently, so a
  difficulty frozen at yesterday's value next to a ticking height has to be
  visible as such. Hover the figure for the exact value and its "as of".
- A DB the proxy has never published to shows a **dash**, not `0`. A chain
  whose difficulty is unknown must not render as a chain at difficulty zero;
  that reads as a claim, and it is the opposite one.

The displayed form is scaled (`126.98 T`, `111.16 k`) and the exact value is
in the element's title. Below difficulty 1 it switches to significant figures
rather than decimals, for the same reason `src/config.c` prints this number
with `%g`: a forknet runs at 4.66e-10, which `toFixed(2)` renders as `0.00`.

## Theme

Light by default, dark one click away. The toggle is in both navs; it writes
`data-theme` onto `<html>` and remembers the choice in `localStorage` under
`sp-theme`.

Three rules hold this together, and each of them broke once while it was
being written — `test/theme.test.js` now guards all three:

1. **`partial/head.ejs` re-applies the saved theme before the stylesheet
   paints.** Every page reloads itself on a `<meta refresh>` timer, so a theme
   applied from the deferred script flashes the other one every 15 seconds.
2. **`script.js` loads from the head, on every page.** The button is in the
   shared nav, so a view that does not load the script renders a nav with a
   permanently hidden button.
3. **It loads exactly once.** Two copies bind two click handlers, the theme
   flips twice, and the button looks dead.

`prefers-color-scheme` is deliberately not consulted. The choice here is the
operator's, and a dashboard that ignores its own toggle because the laptop is
in dark mode is the worse surprise.

Colours are all `--token`s defined twice, once per palette, in
`public/style.css`. **Views must not hardcode a colour** — use `.ok`, `.bad`,
`.warn-text` or `.callout`. A hex in a view is a value that stays
dark-theme-coloured on a light page; there is a test for that too.

## Density

Two blocks on the public pages are folded shut by default, because both are
reference material that is right the first time you land and in the way on
the two-hundredth refresh. Nothing is removed — both are one click open:

- **"About the numbers on this page"** on `/`: four screens of prose on how
  this mode pays and how to point a rig at it. The summary names the mode, so
  which of the five stories is inside is still obvious from the closed state.
- **"Recent shares"** on `/worker/:name`: the 200-row raw share log. The
  figures that answer "is my rig working" are all in the cards above it. It
  renders open when a worker has no shares at all, where there is nothing to
  fold.

`/` also merges what used to be two cards — 24h shares and lifetime totals —
into one, with lifetime as a quieter second row. Same five figures, one card's
worth of page for the comparison they exist to support.

## Pool identity

Every page carries a strip under the header naming what this pool actually
is: the **network** its coinbases are built for, the **mode** (one of `solo`,
`pps-classic`, `pplns-thunder`, `pplns-btc` or `pplns-coinbase`) and fee, the
**coinbase tag**, the **operator address** the fee is paid to, and — in the
modes that pool the reward — the **pool wallet** the net-of-fee reward goes
to. `/api/status` returns the same fields under `pool`.

None of it is derivable from the stratum URL a miner was handed. The port
looks identical whether the pool is mining mainnet or regtest, whether a
block pays its finder or the pool's wallet, and whoever collects the fee.

The dashboard does **not** take these from its own environment. The proxy
writes them to `pool_meta` at startup and the dashboard reads them back —
same rule as the PPS rate, and for the same reason: a second copy of the
config is a copy that can disagree with the pool it claims to describe.
The practical consequence is that the strip reads `unknown` until the proxy
has restarted onto a build that publishes them. That is deliberate; a banner
that asserts the wrong network is worse than one that admits it doesn't know.

`network_source` says how the network was determined:

| Value      | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `node`     | `getblockchaininfo` answered. Authoritative. |
| `inferred` | It did not — the CUSF enforcer serves only `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` — so the network was read off the operator address. Cannot distinguish testnet from signet, and says so. |

A non-mainnet pool is flagged with a warn-coloured rule, because "why has my
payout not arrived" and "this pool is mining signet" are frequently the same
question.

## "About the numbers on this page"

The explanatory card on `/` branches on `pool_mode`, because almost nothing
in it is shared between the modes:

| | `solo` | `pps-classic` | `pplns-thunder` | `pplns-btc` | `pplns-coinbase` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A share that isn't a block | worth nothing | credited at the live rate | a claim on the next block found | a claim on the next block found | a claim on the next block found |
| Block reward goes to | the finder, in the coinbase | the pool's BTC wallet | the pool's BTC wallet | the pool's BTC wallet | **the whole window, in the coinbase** |
| A balance moves | never | as each share arrives | on maturity, over Thunder | on maturity, on L1 | never — the block is the payment |
| Stratum username | a **Bitcoin** address (P2WPKH / P2PKH / P2SH — **not** taproot) | a **Thunder** address | a **Thunder** address | a **Bitcoin** address | a **Bitcoin** address |
| Rejection if you get it wrong | `invalid payout address in stratum username` | `invalid thunder address` | `invalid thunder address` | `invalid payout address in stratum username` | `invalid payout address in stratum username` |

The username row is why this is not cosmetic. `src/stratum.c` branches at
authorize, so the card's instructions are load-bearing: a pool that tells
miners to use a Thunder address when it wants a Bitcoin one is telling them to
do the one thing that cannot work.

**`pplns-coinbase` gets one more thing the others do not: the payout floor.**
That mode does not pay a claim worth less than `pplns_payout_floor_sats` — it
shares it out among the miners that block could pay — never the operator, who
takes only its fee — and puts the skipped miner first in the queue for the next
block. The card says all three things, because a miner deciding whether to
point a rig here needs to know that being small costs them frequency rather
than money, and that nothing is being held on their behalf. The card states the number before anyone connects, because the
operator's log is the one place the miner it costs cannot look. It renders
only when the proxy published a floor (`pool_meta.pplns_payout_floor_sats`);
an older proxy stores NULL, and printing a default there would be stating some
other operator's policy for them.

A note on what this card used to do: it branched on `solo` / `pps-classic`
only, so all three PPLNS modes fell through to *"this pool has not published
its mode yet"* — directly beneath an identity strip that named the mode
correctly — followed by connection guidance for two modes, neither of which
was theirs. Three other places answered "not `pps-classic`" with the word
*solo*: the worker page's **Owed** field, the templates page's PPS rate, and
the `pps_difficulty` health check. If you add a sixth mode, those are the
places to check.

Every figure comes from `pool_meta` — rate, gross, fee, operator address,
pool wallet, network — and the address examples follow the pool's network, so
a signet pool shows `tb1q…` rather than `bc1q…`. Nothing in the card is a
literal. The version this replaced hardcoded *"1 000 sats × share
difficulty"*, which was never true of a rate that is derived per template and
moves with difficulty; a pinned rate (`rate_source = override`) is now called
out with the fee it actually implies.

Unknown mode gets prose naming both, and no username form — same rule as the
identity strip, since guessing wrong costs a miner real time.

## Build provenance — `/api/versions`

Answers "which commit is this pool actually running?" for simplepool, the
bip300301 enforcer, thunder, and bitcoind — without SSHing anywhere.

The commit is looked for **in the artifact first and in a source tree only as
a last resort**, because a checkout's HEAD is not what the running binary was
built from. Three sources, in descending order of what they prove:

| `provenance` | Source | What it proves |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------- |
| `binary`   | `<bin> --version` prints the commit | The answer travels inside the thing it describes. Nothing to keep in sync. |
| `manifest` | `<bin>.build.json`, pinned by sha256 | Recorded at build time; survives the source being deleted. |
| `checkout` | the git tree beside the binary | What *would* be built now — not what is running. Never required. |

simplepool and the enforcer embed their commit, so they resolve at `binary`.
thunder and bitcoind print a version number and no commit; they resolve at
`manifest` once you have run `scripts/record-build.sh` (below). Without a
manifest they fall back to `checkout` and say so in `notes`.

Alongside the resolved `commit` / `branch` / `repo`, each component carries
the evidence it was derived from:

- **`running`** — the live process, found through `/proc/<pid>/exe`, so it
  describes what is serving traffic rather than whatever now sits at the
  configured path. `binary_replaced: true` means the file was rebuilt and the
  service never restarted; `process_found: false` means nothing is running it.
- **`manifest`** — the recorded build, with `verified` false if the binary's
  sha256 has moved since (rebuilt without re-recording). A stale manifest is
  reported, and ranked *below* the checkout rather than trusted.
- **`checkout`** — remote, branch, HEAD, and whether tracked files have been
  modified since (`dirty`).

`commit_matches` cross-checks whichever pairs exist, and is `null` — never an
optimistic `true` — when only one source knew a commit. `all_clean` plus
`needs_review` summarise the whole report in one field.

### Recording a build

Run this right after building any component that doesn't embed its own
commit, in the same script that does the build so the two can't drift:

```
scripts/record-build.sh thunder \
    ~/forknet-software/thunder-rust \
    ~/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/release/thunder_app
```

It writes `<binary>.build.json` next to the binary. After that the checkout
can be deleted and `/api/versions` still answers — source is a build-time
dependency, not a runtime one. `scripts/deploy-to-server.sh` does this for
simplepool automatically.

### Configuration

Paths default to the layout this pool deploys with — all four checkouts as
siblings of the simplepool repo — and are overridden per component with
`SIMPLEPOOL_REPO_DIR` / `SIMPLEPOOL_BIN`, `ENFORCER_REPO_DIR` /
`ENFORCER_BIN`, `THUNDER_REPO_DIR` / `THUNDER_BIN`, `BITCOIN_REPO_DIR` /
`BITCOIND_BIN`, and `<COMPONENT>_BUILD_MANIFEST` for a manifest kept
somewhere other than beside the binary. Set both of a pair empty to drop that
component. `VERSIONS_USE_CHECKOUT=0` disables the git fallback entirely, for
a deployment that ships binaries without source.

Results are cached for `VERSIONS_TTL_MS` (default 5 min) since they only
change on restart; add `?force=1` right after a redeploy.

Absolute paths are deliberately not in the response; repo URLs are stripped
of any embedded credentials.

## Public deployment (nginx)

Reverse-proxy with optional basic auth, gzip, and a tiny cache for `/api/*`:

```nginx
proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx/simplepool levels=1:2 keys_zone=simplepool:10m
                 max_size=100m inactive=10m use_temp_path=off;

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pool.example.com;

    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;

    # auth_basic           "simplepool";
    # auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8081;
        proxy_cache        simplepool;
        proxy_cache_valid  200 5s;
        add_header         X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8081;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## How hashrate is estimated

```
H/s ≈ sum(difficulty over window) * 2^32 / seconds_the_shares_span
```

This is the standard pool estimator, with one correction. The divisor is
the span the shares actually cover — first share in the window to now —
not the nominal width of the window. Dividing by time nothing was mined
in reports a rate nobody ran at, and it goes wrong exactly when someone
is most likely to be looking: a pool eleven hours old reads half its true
rate against a 24 h window, and a rig ten minutes into a rented contract
reads 1/144th of what it is doing. Both heal on their own as the window
fills, which is why it survived so long — by the time anyone doubts the
number it is right again.

The span is clamped at both ends: never longer than the nominal window,
and never shorter than a minute, so a single share a few seconds old
cannot divide by ~0 and report a gigahash spike. With no shares at all it
falls back to the nominal window, so an idle pool reports zero rather
than a clamped fraction of nothing.

It still converges slowly for workers with very few shares in-window —
that is variance, not a divisor problem.
