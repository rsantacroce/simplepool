# simplepool dashboard

A small read-only Node.js dashboard for the [simplepool](../) solo-mining
stratum server (the one with direct miner payouts + a small operator
fee). It opens a **snapshot** of the proxy's SQLite database in
read-only WAL mode and serves a public web page with hashrate, a worker
leaderboard, recent blocks, a historical "blocks found by the pool"
page, and a per-worker drilldown.

Each worker row in the leaderboard is a `<bitcoin_address>.<rig_label>`
pair (stratum username convention); the `workers.payout_address` column
lets future views roll up multiple rigs per address. The historical
blocks panel at `/blocks` reads `blocks_found` and shows finder,
payout address, on-chain reward, and operator fee for every block the
pool has ever solved.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- The `simplepool` binary writing to a SQLite file (default `../data/shares.db`)
- A periodic snapshot at `../data/shares.snapshot.db` produced via
  `sqlite3 shares.db ".backup shares.snapshot.db"` on a cron — see the
  proxy [README](../README.md#database--dashboard-snapshot).

The dashboard opens the snapshot **read-only**. SQLite's online backup is
atomic, so the snapshot is always a consistent view of the live DB and the
proxy is never blocked by dashboard queries. It is safe to point multiple
dashboard instances at the same snapshot file.

## Install

```
cd simplepool/dashboard
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env if your DB path or port differs
```

## Run

```
npm start          # production
npm run dev        # auto-restart on file change
```

Defaults: `PORT=8081`, `PROXY_DB_PATH=../data/shares.snapshot.db`.

If the snapshot file doesn't exist yet, the dashboard starts anyway and
displays "no data yet" until the first `.backup` produces it. You can also
point `PROXY_DB_PATH` at the live `shares.db` if you don't want to run a
snapshot cron — SQLite's WAL mode makes that safe too, just less isolated.

## Endpoints

| Path                  | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                   | Overview, leaderboard, last 5 blocks                    |
| `/blocks`             | Full historical "blocks found by the pool", paginated   |
| `/blocks?before=<ts>` | Next page (older than the given UNIX timestamp)         |
| `/worker/:name`       | Per-worker drilldown                                    |
| `/api/overview`       | JSON                                                    |
| `/api/leaderboard`    | JSON                                                    |
| `/api/worker/:name`   | JSON                                                    |
| `/api/blocks`         | JSON paginated, `?limit=N&before=<ts>` (default 50)     |
| `/api/versions`       | Build provenance of every component (see below)         |
| `/api/status`         | Everything at once: pool, node, health, versions        |
| `/healthz`            | `{ ok: true, db_ready: bool }`                          |
| `/health`             | Full hard-failure detail; 503 when a check is failing   |

`/api/status` is the one URL to poll if you want a single document: pool
totals and hashrate, mainchain tip, the health checks, and which commit of
each component is running. It always returns 200 — it is a report, and a
report that a check is failing was still produced successfully. Watch
`health.ok` for the condition and `/health` for a status code to alert on.

## Build provenance — `/api/versions`

Answers "which commit is this pool actually running?" for simplepool, the
bip300301 enforcer, thunder, and bitcoind — without SSHing anywhere.

The commit is looked for **in the artifact first and in a source tree only as
a last resort**, because a checkout's HEAD is not what the running binary was
built from. Three sources, in descending order of what they prove:

| `provenance` | Source | What it proves |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------- |
| `binary`   | `<bin> --version` prints the commit | The answer travels inside the thing it describes. Nothing to keep in sync. |
| `manifest` | `<bin>.build.json`, pinned by sha256 | Recorded at build time; survives the source being deleted. |
| `checkout` | the git tree beside the binary | What *would* be built now — not what is running. Never required. |

simplepool and the enforcer embed their commit, so they resolve at `binary`.
thunder and bitcoind print a version number and no commit; they resolve at
`manifest` once you have run `scripts/record-build.sh` (below). Without a
manifest they fall back to `checkout` and say so in `notes`.

Alongside the resolved `commit` / `branch` / `repo`, each component carries
the evidence it was derived from:

- **`running`** — the live process, found through `/proc/<pid>/exe`, so it
  describes what is serving traffic rather than whatever now sits at the
  configured path. `binary_replaced: true` means the file was rebuilt and the
  service never restarted; `process_found: false` means nothing is running it.
- **`manifest`** — the recorded build, with `verified` false if the binary's
  sha256 has moved since (rebuilt without re-recording). A stale manifest is
  reported, and ranked *below* the checkout rather than trusted.
- **`checkout`** — remote, branch, HEAD, and whether tracked files have been
  modified since (`dirty`).

`commit_matches` cross-checks whichever pairs exist, and is `null` — never an
optimistic `true` — when only one source knew a commit. `all_clean` plus
`needs_review` summarise the whole report in one field.

### Recording a build

Run this right after building any component that doesn't embed its own
commit, in the same script that does the build so the two can't drift:

```
scripts/record-build.sh thunder \
    ~/forknet-software/thunder-rust \
    ~/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/release/thunder_app
```

It writes `<binary>.build.json` next to the binary. After that the checkout
can be deleted and `/api/versions` still answers — source is a build-time
dependency, not a runtime one. `scripts/deploy-to-server.sh` does this for
simplepool automatically.

### Configuration

Paths default to the layout this pool deploys with — all four checkouts as
siblings of the simplepool repo — and are overridden per component with
`SIMPLEPOOL_REPO_DIR` / `SIMPLEPOOL_BIN`, `ENFORCER_REPO_DIR` /
`ENFORCER_BIN`, `THUNDER_REPO_DIR` / `THUNDER_BIN`, `BITCOIN_REPO_DIR` /
`BITCOIND_BIN`, and `<COMPONENT>_BUILD_MANIFEST` for a manifest kept
somewhere other than beside the binary. Set both of a pair empty to drop that
component. `VERSIONS_USE_CHECKOUT=0` disables the git fallback entirely, for
a deployment that ships binaries without source.

Results are cached for `VERSIONS_TTL_MS` (default 5 min) since they only
change on restart; add `?force=1` right after a redeploy.

Absolute paths are deliberately not in the response; repo URLs are stripped
of any embedded credentials.

## Public deployment (nginx)

Reverse-proxy with optional basic auth, gzip, and a tiny cache for `/api/*`:

```nginx
proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx/simplepool levels=1:2 keys_zone=simplepool:10m
                 max_size=100m inactive=10m use_temp_path=off;

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pool.example.com;

    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;

    # auth_basic           "simplepool";
    # auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8081;
        proxy_cache        simplepool;
        proxy_cache_valid  200 5s;
        add_header         X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8081;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## How hashrate is estimated

```
H/s ≈ sum(difficulty over window) * 2^32 / window_seconds
```

This is the standard pool estimator. It converges quickly for healthy
workers and is meaningless for workers with very few shares in-window.
