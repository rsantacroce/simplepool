/* The "about the numbers" card.
 *
 * The card it replaces stated the pps-classic story unconditionally, which
 * on a solo pool told miners to authorize with a Thunder address — rejected
 * by stratum.c with "invalid payout address in stratum username". So these
 * tests are mostly about the card not saying the other mode's thing: what a
 * share is worth and what the username must be are exactly the two facts
 * that differ, and both cost a miner real time when stated wrongly.
 *
 * The rate is asserted to be the live one, never a literal. The literal it
 * replaces ("1 000 sats × share difficulty") was hardcoded HTML describing a
 * rate that is derived per template and moves with difficulty.
