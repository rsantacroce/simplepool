# Pool operator guide (pps-thunder-classic)

Everything you need to run this pool day-to-day. Assumes the branch
already deployed (see `PPS_THUNDER.md` and `CLASSIC_PAYOUTS.md` for
background on why the design looks like this).

---

## Quick reference

Substitute your own pool's public IP/hostname for `<pool-host>` and your
SSH key file for `<ssh-key>` below. On the deployment I built alongside
this doc, the real values are stashed in a gitignored `FORKNET_CHEATSHEET.md`
at the repo root — do NOT paste real hosts / passwords into anything
tracked by git.

| what | where | credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public dashboard | `http://<pool-host>:8081/` | none |
| **Admin dashboard** | `http://<pool-host>:8081/admin` | **`admin` / `<see /root/simplepool-admin-cred.txt on the box>`** |
| Admin JSON API | `http://<pool-host>:8081/api/admin/summary` | same basic auth |
| Stratum (miner endpoint) | `stratum+tcp://<pool-host>:3334` | username = Thunder base58 address |
| SSH | `root@<pool-host>` | `<ssh-key>` |

The admin password is stashed at `/root/simplepool-admin-cred.txt` on the
box (root-only). To rotate, edit
`/etc/systemd/system/simplepool-dashboard.service.d/pps-thunder.conf`
and `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart simplepool-dashboard`
— there's a scripted version in [Rotating the admin
password](#rotating-the-admin-password) below.

---

## Where things live on the box

- **Root**: `/home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/`
  - `simplepool/` — this repo, checked out at `pps-thunder-classic`
  - `data/shares.db` — pool state (SQLite, WAL mode)
  - `data/archive/` — old DB snapshots from mode switches
  - `logs/` — pool + payout + Thunder logs (plus stashed Thunder mnemonic)
  - `thunder-data/` — Thunder node chain data

- **Services** (all `systemctl status <name>`):
  - `simplepool.service` — the stratum proxy (managed manually right now;
    launched via `nohup` from the deploy). Systemd unit exists but not
    always enabled.
  - `simplepool-payout.service` — Node payout worker
  - `simplepool-dashboard.service` — Node public + admin dashboards

- **Config**: `/home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/simplepool/proxy.conf`
  (gitignored). Current `pool_mode = pps-classic`.

Everything before `pool_btc_address` runs automatically. Everything
after is either automatic (payout worker) or one operator action
per deposit (moving BTC into Thunder).

---

## Daily operations

### 1. Health check (30 seconds)

Open the admin dashboard. Look at the top three cards:

- **Thunder reserve** — how much you can pay out right now
- **PPS ledger totals** — how much you *owe* (owed = accrued − paid)
- **⚠ Reserve is short** banner — appears when owed > available; means
  the payout worker will keep skipping ticks until you deposit more BTC

If you see a `⚠` banner AND owed is significant, do a deposit (below).

Also check the **In-flight payouts** card — should be empty. Any row
with a set `txid` means a payout crashed mid-flight and needs manual
reconciliation.

### 2. Deposit BTC into Thunder (when reserve is short)

**Currently manual — no admin button yet.** The runbook:

```sh
ssh -i <ssh-key> root@<pool-host>

# 1. Get a Thunder-owned deposit address (BARE base58 — 20-byte hash).
#    Do NOT use `format-deposit-address`; that produces the display-only
#    `s<n>_<base58>_<hex6>` wrapper that Thunder's own OP_RETURN parser
#    rejects. Empirically verified — deposits to the wrapper form are
#    logged as "Ignoring invalid deposit address" and end up unpayable.
TCLI=/home/forknet/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/debug/thunder_app_cli
POOL_ADDR=$(sudo -u forknet $TCLI get-new-address)
echo "deposit target: $POOL_ADDR"

# 2. Trigger the deposit via the enforcer's wallet. AMOUNT + FEE are yours to pick.
GRPCURL=/home/forknet/forknet-software/grpcurl
AMOUNT_SATS=1000000     # 0.01 BTC = 1_000_000 sats
FEE_SATS=1000
$GRPCURL -plaintext \
  -d "{\"sidechain_id\":9,\"address\":\"$POOL_ADDR\",\"value_sats\":$AMOUNT_SATS,\"fee_sats\":$FEE_SATS}" \
  127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.WalletService/CreateDepositTransaction

# 3. Wait for a natural mainchain block from your miner (or on regtest,
#    force one with GenerateBlocks).
$GRPCURL -plaintext -d '{"blocks":1}' \
  127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.WalletService/GenerateBlocks

# 4. Confirm the Ctip moved
$GRPCURL -plaintext -d '{"sidechain_number":9}' \
  127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.ValidatorService/GetCtip

# 5. Poke Thunder to include the new deposit in a sidechain block.
#    `mine` may time out on the client side but the block gets produced.
curl -sS --max-time 15 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"mine","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:6009/

# 6. Confirm Thunder's wallet balance grew
sudo -u forknet $TCLI balance
```

**About the "enforcer's wallet"**: the enforcer runs its own on-box BTC
wallet, seeded during the setup phase. Its balance is visible via
`WalletService/GetBalance`. Right now it's ~1 BTC because we mined some
funding blocks during activation. **Long-term**, you want the pool
coinbase to accumulate straight into an enforcer-wallet-owned address —
that means changing `pool_btc_address` in `proxy.conf` to an address
generated by `WalletService/CreateNewAddress` on the enforcer. Until
that's done, the operator's own BTC (at the current `pool_btc_address`)
sits in an external wallet the enforcer can't spend directly.

### 3. Watch payouts land

After a deposit completes:

```sh
# tail the payout worker
sudo journalctl -u simplepool-payout.service -f
# or read the log directly:
tail -f /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/logs/payout.log
```

You should see lines like:
```
payout: 3Z6z1hPySN…rig1 -> 3Z6z1hPySN… 96085 sats txid=…
```

Refresh the admin dashboard — `owed` should drop, `paid` should rise,
`in-flight` should stay empty.

**Known Thunder-side gotcha:** for `payout: reserve short — available=0`
to actually go away, Thunder itself has to mine a sidechain block (BMM)
that recognizes the deposit. Deposits are always visible on the
enforcer's Ctip, but Thunder's own wallet balance stays 0 until BMM
runs. On this box Thunder's `mine` RPC is currently blocking without
producing a sidechain block — likely a BMM-side infrastructure issue
that needs investigation. In the meantime, the pool correctly logs the
short-reserve state and does not double-pay or lose accrual data.

### 4. Reconciling stuck payouts

If the admin dashboard's **In-flight payouts** card is non-empty, each
row means a payout crashed between broadcast and DB finalize. Two cases:

- **`txid = —`** (no txid): the broadcast never happened. Safe to just
  delete the row and let the worker retry next tick:
  ```sh
  sudo -u forknet sqlite3 /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/data/shares.db \
    "DELETE FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = <ID>;"
  ```

- **`txid = <something>`**: the Thunder tx went out; the DB finalize
  crashed. Verify the tx is on Thunder (via `thunder_app_cli
  get-transaction <txid>` or a Thunder wallet viewer). If confirmed,
  finalize by hand:
  ```sh
  sudo -u forknet sqlite3 /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/data/shares.db "
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE pps_credits SET paid_sats = paid_sats + (SELECT sats FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = <ID>)
                       WHERE worker_id = (SELECT worker_id FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = <ID>);
    DELETE FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = <ID>;
    COMMIT;
  "
  ```

The pool never auto-resolves in-flight rows because it can't safely
tell apart "broadcast didn't happen" from "broadcast happened,
finalize crashed" without Thunder-side mempool/chain lookup.

---

## Onboarding a new miner

Nothing on the pool side. The miner points their ASIC firmware at:

```
stratum+tcp://<pool-host>:3334
username: <their-Thunder-address>[.<rig_label>]
password: (anything)
```

The username **must** be a valid Thunder address — base58 of a 20-byte
hash. If they don't have a Thunder wallet, tell them to run a Thunder
node and do `thunder-cli get-new-address`.

A Bitcoin address as the username produces `invalid thunder address:
thunder address decoded length 25 (expected 20)` on authorize and no
shares accrue. Rejects show up in the admin dashboard's implicit
`rejects` table (surfaced on the per-worker page) so you can help
someone debug their config.

**Same address, multiple rigs:** append `.<rig_label>` (e.g.
`3Z6z1hPySN….basement`, `3Z6z1hPySN….garage`). They show as separate
rows on the workers page but the same payout address on the admin
view.

---

## Rotating the admin password

```sh
ssh -i <ssh-key> root@<pool-host>
NEW_PASS=$(openssl rand -base64 21 | tr -d '=+/')
sed -i "s/^Environment=ADMIN_PASSWORD=.*/Environment=ADMIN_PASSWORD=$NEW_PASS/" \
  /etc/systemd/system/simplepool-dashboard.service.d/pps-thunder.conf
echo "admin / $NEW_PASS" > /root/simplepool-admin-cred.txt
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart simplepool-dashboard.service
cat /root/simplepool-admin-cred.txt
```

Old password stops working immediately; the dashboard is up in ~1s.

---

## Rolling back / switching modes

To pause and restore the old solo pool exactly as it was:

```sh
# stop pps-classic pool
pkill -9 -x simplepool
# start the pre-existing solo unit (still installed)
systemctl start simplepool.service
```

That points at the OLD proxy.conf at `~/forknet-software/simplepool/`.
The dashboard drop-in stays pointed at the pps-classic DB by default;
edit `/etc/systemd/system/simplepool-dashboard.service.d/pps-thunder.conf`
if you want to swing it back to the solo DB.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "invalid thunder address" reject storm

A miner is using a BTC address. Have them update their firmware config
to use a Thunder address. Until they do, they burn hashrate for zero
credit — the pool has no fallback.

### Payout worker log shows `reserve short — available=0` forever

Either (a) you haven't done a deposit yet (see runbook above), or (b)
you deposited but Thunder hasn't seen the credit yet due to BMM not
running. Check with:

```sh
# enforcer says the deposit was consensus-accepted?
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"sidechain_number":9}' \
  127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.ValidatorService/GetCtip
# Thunder wallet sees the balance?
sudo -u forknet /home/forknet/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/debug/thunder_app_cli balance
```

If Ctip shows the deposit but Thunder wallet balance is 0, it's a
BMM/Thunder-side sync issue. Escalate to Thunder infra.

### Dashboard shows the OLD DB (pre-pps-classic reset)

Check the drop-in override:
```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/simplepool-dashboard.service.d/pps-thunder.conf
# PROXY_DB_PATH should be /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/data/shares.db
```
Fix + `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart simplepool-dashboard`.

### Simplepool won't start — `Address already in use`

There's a stale binary still bound. **DO NOT** `pkill -f simplepool`
from an SSH session — that pattern matches your own command line and
kills your SSH. Use exact-name match instead:

```sh
pkill -9 -x simplepool
sleep 2
ss -tlnp | grep :3334 || echo ":3334 free"
```

### Miner shares accrue but payouts never fire

Read the payout log. Common causes:
- Reserve short (fix: deposit)
- Thunder RPC unreachable (fix: `systemctl status`, log tail)
- Worker's Thunder address is `NULL` in the `workers` table (means it
  never authorized cleanly — check the `rejects` table for that
  worker_name)

### "⚠ Reserve is short by N sats" banner on /admin

The admin dashboard's PPS ledger card is telling you the payout worker's
next tick will see less BTC in Thunder than the sum of everything the
pool owes. The worker keeps skipping ticks (correctly — its policy is
"pay everyone or nobody" to prevent partial-payout states) until you
close the gap by moving BTC through the two-step deposit flow.

**Where BTC lives at each step:**

```

The banner means "step 1 + step 2 haven't happened recently enough."
Runbook to close it:

**How much to deposit.** Rule of thumb: **1.1× the current owed**,
i.e. enough to cover the debt plus headroom for the fee_sats budget +
new shares landing while you deposit. Read `totals.owed` off
`/api/admin/summary` (admin auth) for the current number.

**Step 1 — fund the enforcer wallet from the operator wallet.**

```sh
ssh -i <ssh-key> root@<pool-host>
GRPCURL=/home/forknet/forknet-software/grpcurl
BCLI="/home/forknet/forknet-software/drivechain-forknet/build/bin/bitcoin-cli \
    -datadir=/home/forknet/.drivechain-forknet \
    -rpcuser=<rpcuser> -rpcpassword=<rpcpassword> \
    -rpcwallet=<wallet-name>"

# Fresh enforcer-owned receive address (one per deposit).
ENF=$($GRPCURL -plaintext 127.0.0.1:50051 \
      cusf.mainchain.v1.WalletService/CreateNewAddress \
      | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['address'])")
echo "enforcer receive: $ENF"

# Send the target amount from the operator wallet. Wait for the next
# natural mainchain block (30-60s in a healthy miner) to confirm.
$BCLI sendtoaddress "$ENF" <btc_amount>
```

**Step 2 — deposit from the enforcer wallet into Thunder.**

```sh
TCLI=/home/forknet/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/debug/thunder_app_cli

# BARE Thunder address ONLY. Do NOT use `format-deposit-address` — the
# 's<n>_<base58>_<hex6>' wrapper is rejected by Thunder's OP_RETURN
# parser and any deposit to it ends up at a fallback address the pool
# doesn't own. Empirically verified; the C-side authorize check now
# rejects wrapper-form usernames for the same reason.
POOL_ADDR=$(sudo -u forknet $TCLI get-new-address)
echo "deposit target: $POOL_ADDR"

# Capture Ctip before so we can verify it moves.
CTIP_BEFORE=$($GRPCURL -plaintext -d '{"sidechain_number":9}' \
    127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.ValidatorService/GetCtip)
echo "$CTIP_BEFORE"

# Deposit — value is in sats. E.g. 5 BTC = 500_000_000, 50 BTC = 5_000_000_000.
DEPOSIT_SATS=<sats>
$GRPCURL -plaintext \
    -d "{\"sidechain_id\":9,\"address\":\"$POOL_ADDR\",\
\"value_sats\":$DEPOSIT_SATS,\"fee_sats\":1000}" \
    127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.WalletService/CreateDepositTransaction
```

Wait for a mainchain block, then confirm the Ctip grew by roughly
`DEPOSIT_SATS`:

```sh
$GRPCURL -plaintext -d '{"sidechain_number":9}' \
    127.0.0.1:50051 cusf.mainchain.v1.ValidatorService/GetCtip
```

**Step 3 — poke Thunder to include the deposit in a sidechain block.**

```sh
curl -sS --max-time 15 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"mine","params":[]}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:6009/

# balance should now show the new sats
sudo -u forknet $TCLI balance
```

Client-side `mine` sometimes times out at ~12s but the block gets
produced anyway — the timeout is on the RPC response, not the actual
work. Re-check `balance` after 30s if the first check still shows 0.

**Step 4 — log it so the admin dashboard's "Deposits" card shows the row.**

```sh
scripts/log-deposit.sh \
    --db /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/data/shares.db \
    --txid <mainchain txid from step 2> \
    --sats $DEPOSIT_SATS --fee 1000 \
    --recipient $POOL_ADDR \
    --ctip-before <n> --ctip-after <n> \
    --note "top-up to cover payout backlog"
```

The payout worker's next tick (max 30s later) then sees
`available_sats >= totals.owed + fees`, drops the warning banner, and
starts firing Thunder transfers. Each one lands in the admin's
"Recent payouts" card with its txid; miners see the same txid on their
public per-worker page.

**Doing it in smaller rounds.** The current all-or-nothing worker policy
(pay everyone or nobody) means even 90% of the owed sum still won't
trip the gate — save yourself the disappointment and either close the
gap completely in one round, or land the partial-payout policy first
(sort due workers by `owed ASC`, pay whoever fits, stop when the next
one won't fit; ~15 LoC in `payout/lib/payout.js`).

**If the Ctip moves but Thunder balance stays at 0.** BMM is stalled.
Restart Thunder to unblock it:

```sh
pkill -x thunder_app
sudo -u forknet -H bash -c "
    /home/forknet/forknet-software/thunder-rust/target/debug/thunder_app \
        --headless --datadir /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/thunder-data \
        --network forknet --mainchain-grpc-url http://127.0.0.1:50051 \
        --net-addr 127.0.0.1:4009 --rpc-addr 127.0.0.1:6009 \
        --log-level INFO \
        > /home/forknet/pps-thunder-test/logs/thunder.log 2>&1 &"
```

Give it ~30s to sync and re-run step 3.

## Open items on the operator side

1. **Point `pool_btc_address` at an enforcer-wallet-owned address** so
   the enforcer can spend accumulated coinbase directly into deposit
   txs. Right now it's set to the operator's external wallet — every
   deposit currently spends the enforcer's own seed funds.
2. **BMM / Thunder sidechain block production** on this box currently
   doesn't complete. Deposits are consensus-recognized (Ctip updates)
   but Thunder wallet balance stays 0 until BMM runs. Investigating
   this is a Thunder-side task, not a pool task.
3. **Admin "Deposit to Thunder" form** — CLASSIC_PAYOUTS.md sketches
   the endpoint (`POST /admin/deposit`) but it's not implemented yet.
   Until it lands, deposits are the CLI runbook above.

None of these block the pool from running correctly — they're
improvements to the operator UX and end-to-end value flow, not
correctness gaps.
