# simplepool

A small, single-binary **solo-mining stratum server** in pure C11. It accepts
miner connections on TCP `:3334`, builds block templates via `bitcoind`'s
`getblocktemplate`, submits found blocks via `submitblock`, and records every
accepted share into a local SQLite database. A separate Node.js dashboard
reads a snapshot of that file for stats.

It is a **solo pool with direct payouts**: every coinbase has two outputs —
the **miner who found the block gets the reward** (minus a small operator
fee), and the configured `operator_address` gets the rest (default 1% =
100 basis points, configurable via `fee_bps`). Each connected miner gets
its own coinbase rendered against the miner's own address; the merkle
branches, prev-hash, ntime, etc. are shared.

There is **no PPS**, no inter-miner reward sharing, and no
difficulty-weighted accounting. If your miner finds the block, your
address gets ~99% of the subsidy + fees on-chain in the same coinbase
transaction; if it doesn't, nobody on this proxy gets anything for that
height. The `shares` and `workers` tables exist purely so the dashboard
can show a leaderboard, per-worker drilldown, and historical "blocks
found by the pool" view.

### Stratum username convention

The `mining.authorize` username must start with the miner's Bitcoin
address. Format:

```
<bitcoin_address>[.<rig_label>]
```

- `bitcoin_address` is required and must be a valid bech32 (P2WPKH) or
  base58check (P2PKH / P2SH) address. It is parsed at authorize time
  and an invalid address is rejected with a clear error and logged in
  the `rejects` table.
- `rig_label` is optional and lets a single miner (same address) have
  multiple rigs in the leaderboard as separate rows. Use anything
  alphanumeric plus `_` `-`.
- The **password is discarded** entirely. There are no accounts and no
  auth.

Examples: `bc1qabc…`, `bc1qabc….basement-rig`, `bcrt1q…test.alice`.

This is a **sibling project** to the Rust mining pool that lives elsewhere in
this same monorepo. The two share nothing in code or goals: the Rust pool is
a production-style PPS pool with payouts; `simplepool` is intentionally minimal
and exists for solo mining + observability only.

Status: **wired**. The main binary loads config, connects to bitcoind,
opens the SQLite store, builds an initial job from `getblocktemplate`,
serves stratum on the configured port, and watches for new tips on a
background thread.

## Build

Dependencies: `sqlite3`, `libcurl`, `pthread`, plus a C11 compiler.

macOS:
```
brew install sqlite curl
make
```

Debian / Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install build-essential libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
make
```

The binary lands at `build/simplepool`.

## Run

```
cp proxy.conf.example proxy.conf
# edit proxy.conf
./build/simplepool proxy.conf
```

Initialise the SQLite database from the shipped schema:
```
mkdir -p data
sqlite3 data/shares.db < schema.sql
```

## Database & dashboard snapshot

The proxy is the only writer. The database lives at `data/shares.db` and
runs in WAL mode, so a read-only consumer cannot block writes or corrupt
the file.

For the dashboard we still recommend pointing it at a **separate snapshot
file** rather than the live DB. This isolates the dashboard's query load
from the proxy's writer and means a future code change on the dashboard
side can never accidentally open the live file read-write.

Use SQLite's online backup — it is atomic and safe to run while the proxy
is writing. A plain `cp` of a WAL'd database is **not** safe; always use
`.backup`:

```
# one-shot
sqlite3 data/shares.db ".backup data/shares.snapshot.db"
```

Run it on a timer (cron / systemd-timer / launchd), e.g. every minute:

```
* * * * * sqlite3 /path/to/data/shares.db ".backup /path/to/data/shares.snapshot.db"
```

The dashboard reads `data/shares.snapshot.db` by default — see
[`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md).

## Config keys

```
operator_address = bc1q...   # required: recipient of the fee_bps cut
fee_bps          = 100       # 100 = 1%; valid range 0..1000 (max 10%)
coinbase_tag     = /simplepool/ # short string baked into the coinbase scriptSig
```

`fee_bps = 0` disables the fee output (single-payout coinbase, all to
the miner). If the computed fee would be below the relay dust threshold
(~546 sats) the operator output is dropped automatically and the miner
gets the full reward.

## How shares are credited

One accepted share = one row in the `shares` table, tagged with the
`worker_id` resolved from the (sanitized) stratum username — which now
encodes the miner's payout address. The `workers` row stores
`payout_address` separately so the dashboard can also roll up by
address across multiple rigs.

If a share also satisfies the network target, it is additionally
recorded in `blocks_found` with `height`, `hash`, `finder_id`,
`finder_address`, `reward_sats` (paid to the miner), and `fee_sats`
(paid to `operator_address`). The matching `shares` row has
`is_block = 1` and the block hash.

## Run against local regtest

The repo ships a best-effort integration test that exercises the proxy
end-to-end against a regtest `bitcoind`:

```
# bitcoind must already be running with -regtest, RPC on 127.0.0.1:18443,
# user/password "drivepool"/"drivepool" (or override with env vars).
chmod +x tests/test_integration.sh
./tests/test_integration.sh
```

The script:

1. Skips with exit 0 if `bitcoin-cli`, `nc`, or `sqlite3` are missing, or
   if no regtest node is reachable.
2. Mines 101 blocks if needed so templates are non-empty.
3. Writes `tests/integration.proxy.conf` and starts `./build/simplepool` on
   `127.0.0.1:13334` with the DB at `/tmp/simplepool-int.db`.
4. Sends a tiny `mining.subscribe` / `mining.authorize` / stale
   `mining.submit` sequence over `nc`, then `SIGINT`s the proxy.
5. Asserts that `workers` has at least one row, `workers.payout_address`
   is populated, and `rejects` has at least one row.
