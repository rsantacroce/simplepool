# Nonce distribution, share calculation, and audit

How simplepool splits work between connected miners, validates their
share submissions, credits their PPS balance, and lets an operator
(or a suspicious miner) audit every number back to first principles.

Every claim in this document is traceable to a line in the C source or
a table in `shares.db`. Where a specific line is cited (e.g.
`src/stratum.c:688`), that's what to grep to check the code hasn't
drifted.

---

## Part 1 — how the pool divides the search space

### The block header (80 bytes)

Every miner is trying to find a header whose double-SHA256 is smaller
than the network target. The 80-byte block header has these fields:

```
offset  size  field
   0      4   version           (LE, may be "rolled" via a mask)
   4     32   prev_block_hash   (LE)
  36     32   merkle_root       (LE — derived from the coinbase + branches)
  68      4   ntime             (LE)
  72      4   nbits             (LE, network's compact target)
  76      4   nonce             (LE, the tiny 32-bit search space)
```

Only three fields can vary while searching:
- `nonce`               — 2³² = 4.3 billion values, on-header
- version-rolled bits   — a subset of `version` via a mask
- `merkle_root`         — indirectly, by changing the coinbase

The coinbase is where the extranonce lives. Every distinct extranonce
produces a distinct coinbase → a distinct coinbase txid → a distinct
merkle root → a distinct 32-bit nonce search space to sweep.

### The pool's split of the nonce space

simplepool uses the standard stratum-v1 split:

```
coinbase scriptSig layout (assembled at share-check time):

   [ height_push ] [ tag ] [ extranonce1 (4 B) ][ extranonce2 (4 B) ]
                            └── pool assigns ──┘└──  miner picks   ──┘
```

- **extranonce1 (4 bytes, `en1`)** — assigned by the pool when the
  connection subscribes. Immutable for the life of that TCP session.
- **extranonce2 (4 bytes, `en2`)** — the miner's private search field.
  Each `mining.submit` carries an `en2` value; the miner sweeps it
  independently.

Together they give each connection **2⁶⁴ distinct coinbases** to try
before it has to reconnect for a fresh `en1`. At any real hashrate,
that's effectively unbounded.

For each `en2` the miner picks, it then sweeps the header's 4-byte
`nonce` field (2³² hashes) and, if version-rolling was negotiated,
also permutes the masked version bits. So each `en2` value gives
2³² × (rolled-versions) headers to hash.

### Extranonce1 allocation — how uniqueness is guaranteed

`src/stratum.c:688-694`:

```c
/* Allocate extranonce1 from server counter ^ time. */
unsigned seq = atomic_fetch_add(&s->extranonce1_seq, 1);
uint32_t mix = seq ^ (uint32_t)now_ms();
c->extranonce1[0] = (uint8_t)(mix >> 24);
c->extranonce1[1] = (uint8_t)(mix >> 16);
c->extranonce1[2] = (uint8_t)(mix >> 8);
c->extranonce1[3] = (uint8_t)mix;
```

Two properties matter:

1. **Uniqueness across concurrent connects** — `atomic_fetch_add` on
   `extranonce1_seq` guarantees that no two connections can read the
   same `seq` value even if they subscribe in the same nanosecond.
2. **Freshness after counter wrap** — the 32-bit `seq` will wrap
   after 4.3 billion connections. XORing with `now_ms()` (also 32
   bits) ensures that even if a rig disconnects and reconnects days
   later after the counter has cycled, it gets a different `en1`.

**No two miners on the pool are searching the same
`(header, coinbase, nonce)` triple.** That's the fairness guarantee
simplepool makes; there's no reference to a random pool from `/dev/urandom`
or any other entropy source needed to enforce it.

### Multi-rig, same-address

Two ASICs authorizing with the SAME Thunder address but DIFFERENT
`.<rig_label>` suffixes get:

- **Distinct `en1` values** (they're two connections)
- **Merged accrual** in `pps_credits` if the code just keyed on address
- **BUT distinct worker rows** because the `workers.name` uniqueness
  constraint keeps them separate ledger-wise

That means a single miner running `basement.rig` and `garage.rig` from
the same Thunder address sees each rig on the leaderboard and can
attribute contributions per box.

### Version rolling

If a miner supports it (advertised via `mining.configure`), the pool
negotiates a version-bit mask. `src/stratum.c` emits the mask on the
authorize response; the miner is allowed to XOR any bit in the mask
into the header's `version` field.

Current default mask: **`0x1fffe000`** — the 16 bits between position
13 and 28. That expands the effective per-`(en1, en2)` search space by
2¹⁶, so a single `en2` value covers 2³² × 2¹⁶ = 2⁴⁸ ≈ 280 trillion
headers.

**The pool never re-uses a version-rolled header for share
validation**: on submit, the miner tells us the exact rolled version
they used (`rolled=…` in the `[SUBMIT CHECK]` log lines), we
reconstruct the header they hashed, we re-hash it ourselves, and we
compare *that* hash against the worker/network targets. Any
manipulation outside the mask is rejected as invalid.

---

## Part 2 — how shares are calculated

### Header reassembly on submit

When a miner submits `(job_id, en2, ntime, nonce, version_bits)`,
the pool has everything it needs to reconstruct the exact header the
miner hashed:

```
coinbase_hex = cb1_hex || en1 || en2 || cb2_hex
coinbase_txid = dSHA256(coinbase_hex)          # 32 bytes, LE

merkle_root = coinbase_txid
for branch in job.merkle_branches:
    merkle_root = dSHA256(merkle_root || branch)

header = version_LE || prev_hash_LE || merkle_root_LE ||
         ntime_LE || nbits_LE || nonce_LE

share_hash = dSHA256(header)                   # 32 bytes, LE
```

Any deviation from what the miner claims produces a completely
different `share_hash`, which then fails the target check → reject.

### The two targets

Every share is checked against TWO thresholds:

- **Worker target** — the difficulty the pool is currently holding
  this connection at (set via `mining.set_difficulty` per vardiff).
  A hash below this counts as an accepted share and earns PPS credit.

- **Network target** — the current chain difficulty from
  `getblocktemplate` / the enforcer. A hash below this is a valid
  block that the pool will submit via `submitblock`.

Both targets are stored/transmitted as 256-bit numbers, big-endian.
For a hash `h` (interpreted as an unsigned 256-bit big-endian
integer), the checks are:

- Share valid ⇔ `h ≤ worker_target`
- Block found ⇔ `h ≤ network_target`

Since network difficulty is much higher than any reasonable worker
difficulty, `network_target < worker_target` almost always → a
block-finding hash also satisfies the share check → the same submit
counts both as a paid share AND a block.

### The share validation flow

`src/stratum.c` — the submit path:

1. Look up the job by `job_id`. If unknown / expired → reject with
   `stale share`.
2. Reconstruct the coinbase from cached `cb1/cb2` + `(en1, en2)`.
3. Compute the merkle root from `dsha256(coinbase) → branches`.
4. Reconstruct the header with the miner's `version|ntime|nonce`.
5. `dsha256(header)` → `sent_hash`.
6. Log a `[SUBMIT CHECK]` line with `sent_hash`, `worker_target`,
   `network_target`, and version fields (this is what appears in
   `logs/simplepool.log`).
7. Compare against both targets:
   - `sent_hash > worker_target` → reject with `low difficulty`,
     insert a row into `rejects`.
   - Otherwise → insert a row into `shares` with the SHA256 of the
     header as `block_hash` (nullable elsewhere), the connection's
     difficulty as the share's difficulty, and `is_block = 1` iff
     `sent_hash ≤ network_target`.
   - If block: also enqueue `submitblock` to the backend.

### Vardiff

The pool auto-adjusts each connection's difficulty to hit a target
share-rate (`vardiff_target_spm` shares/minute, default 12). See
`src/stratum.c` for the vardiff loop; the tunables in `proxy.conf` are:

- `vardiff_enabled` — 0/1
- `vardiff_target_spm` — target shares per minute
- `vardiff_min` / `vardiff_max` — clamps
- `vardiff_window_sec` — how often to retarget

`mining.set_difficulty` fires whenever the connection's target changes.
The active job stays valid — the target check is per-share.

### Difficulty of a share

Bitcoin's "pdiff-1" target is `0xffff * 2^208`. A share at difficulty
`D` is one whose hash is below `pdiff-1 / D`. Concretely, given a
`worker_target`, the equivalent difficulty is:

```
difficulty = pdiff_1_target / worker_target
```

That's the number stored in `shares.difficulty` for each accepted
share, and the same number used to compute the PPS credit.

### Worked example (from the live pool right now)

The current worker target on the running ASIC is:

```
worker_target = 0x000003e7fc180000...  (hex prefix; rest is zeros)
```

Position of the significant bytes: 5 leading hex zeros followed by
`03e7fc18`. That's `0x03e7fc18 × 2^(51×4)` = `0x03e7fc18 × 2^204`.

pdiff-1 = `0xffff × 2^208`.

```
difficulty = (0xffff × 2^208) / (0x03e7fc18 × 2^204)
           = 0xffff × 2^4 / 0x03e7fc18
           = 65535 × 16 / 65407512
           ≈ 0.01603
```

So this rig's shares are being credited at ~0.016 difficulty each.
That matches what shows up in `shares.difficulty` per row.

Sanity-check hashrate from share rate:

- share_rate = shares_per_second = H / (D × 2^32)
- Observed 14 shares in the last minute → 0.233/s at D=0.016
- H = 0.233 × 0.016 × 2^32 ≈ 16 MH/s

The pool's `hashrate` derivation on the public dashboard follows the
same formula, over `overview.window_sec` (default 24h).

## Part 3 — how payouts are computed

### The formula

The C proxy credits every accepted share with:

```
delta_sats = FLOOR(difficulty × pps_sats_per_diff)
```

`src/main.c` at the `on_share_cb`:

```c
int64_t delta = (int64_t)(difficulty * s->cfg->pps_sats_per_diff);
if (delta > 0) {
    if (s->store) {
        store_record_credit(s->store, worker_name, payout_address,
                            ts_ms, delta);
    }
    ...
}
```

The cast to `int64_t` is a **per-share floor**. That matters for the
audit — see Part 4.

### The `pps_credits` table

One row per worker:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pps_credits (
  worker_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES workers(id),
  accrued_sats  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  paid_sats     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  last_updated  INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

- `accrued_sats` — monotonically-increasing sum of `delta_sats` across
  every share this worker has ever landed. Only the C proxy writes.
- `paid_sats`   — monotonically-increasing sum of settled Thunder
  transfers. Only the payout worker writes.
- Owed at any moment = `accrued_sats - paid_sats`.

The invariants are enforced by the app code, not by DB constraints.
Both fields must always increase; a decrease means somebody edited
the DB by hand.

### The at-most-once payout protocol

`payouts_in_flight` is a WAL for pending payouts. Every payout goes
through three steps:

1. `INSERT INTO payouts_in_flight (worker_id, sats, txid='')`.
2. `thunder.transfer(addr, sats, fee)` — receives a `txid`.
3. ONE atomic SQLite transaction:
   - `UPDATE payouts_in_flight SET txid = ?`
   - `UPDATE pps_credits SET paid_sats = paid_sats + ?`
   - `DELETE FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = ?`

A crash between (1) and (2) leaves a row with `txid=''` — the payout
worker's `listDue` skips this worker until the operator reconciles.
A crash between (2) and (3) leaves a row with `txid` set — the
operator can verify the tx on Thunder and finalize by hand.

Neither state can produce a double-pay because `listDue` skips any
worker with any in-flight row. See `payout/lib/db.js` and
`payout/lib/payout.js`.

## Part 4 — auditing every number

### Per-share record

Each row in `shares` records exactly what was credited:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shares (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  worker_id   INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES workers(id),
  ts          INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- unix seconds
  difficulty  REAL NOT NULL,      -- the worker target's difficulty at submit
  is_block    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  block_hash  TEXT               -- the header dSHA256 (also block hash if is_block=1)
);
```

The row lets you reproduce the credit for a single share as:

```
credit_sats = CAST(difficulty * pps_sats_per_diff AS INTEGER)
            = FLOOR(difficulty × rate)
```

### Reproducing "why is my balance N sats?"

Given a worker's `worker_id` and the pool's current `pps_sats_per_diff`
(call it `rate`), everything below is derivable from `shares` alone —
the `pps_credits.accrued_sats` field is a running total the C proxy
maintains, but you can always recompute it:

```sql
-- expected accrued_sats for one worker, computed from raw shares
SELECT SUM(CAST(difficulty * :rate AS INTEGER)) AS accrued_computed
FROM   shares
WHERE  worker_id = :wid;
```

If this **matches** `pps_credits.accrued_sats` → the C proxy has been
running correctly since the DB was initialized.

If it **doesn't match** → one of:

- The DB was populated across a rate change. The proxy credits shares
  at whatever `pps_sats_per_diff` was set at the time of that share;
  the recomputation above uses a single `rate`. Grep the pool log
  for the startup line `pool_mode=…: … pps_sats_per_diff=…` around
  suspicious timestamps.
- Somebody edited `pps_credits` by hand. Check `sqlite3 .headers on
  .mode column select rowid, * from pps_credits;` for anything odd.
- A SQLite corruption. Extremely rare in WAL mode. If suspected,
  make a `.backup` before touching anything else.

### The admin cross-check

The `/admin/worker/:id` page ([dashboard/views/admin-worker.ejs](dashboard/views/admin-worker.ejs))
implements exactly this — with a visual ✓ / ⚠ badge. It shows:

- **Σ difficulty** (raw sum, no truncation)
- **rate** (`POOL_PPS_SATS_PER_DIFF` env → the value proxy.conf shipped)
- **Σ FLOOR(diff × rate)** — the authoritative sum
- **pps_credits.accrued_sats** — what's stored
- Match indicator

There's also a naive `FLOOR(Σ diff × rate)` shown next to the
authoritative number so operators can quantify how many sats the
per-share truncation "cost" over the window (usually a handful of
sats — one per share whose fractional contribution got rounded away).

### Per-worker audit page — what a miner sees

At `/admin/worker/:id` an operator can:

- Verify the cross-check (see above).
- See the **daily breakdown**: how many shares landed each day, the
  Σ difficulty for the day, sats credited for the day, whether any of
  those shares also happened to be blocks.
- See the **last 100 shares** with a `running_accrued` column that
  walks oldest-first through the visible slice. A miner can literally
  point at share row #872 and read off exactly how many sats they had
  at that moment.

The `/api/admin/worker/:id` JSON endpoint returns the same numbers.
Feed it to a monitoring script or a per-miner email report.

### Reconciling with the enforcer's Ctip

When the classic-mode deposit flow is running, there's a second
audit angle: **every deposit is recorded in the `deposits` table**
with the mainchain `btc_txid`, the amount, the fee, and the Ctip
sequence numbers before + after. That lets an operator or auditor
correlate:

- Sum of `deposits.sats_deposited` since deployment → how much BTC
  crossed onto Thunder.
- Sum of `pps_credits.paid_sats` → how much left Thunder to miners.
- The Ctip's current `value` → how much sits in the reserve.

The three should balance modulo fees. Discrepancies point at either
an off-by-one in the deposit ledger (checkable against
`ValidatorService/GetTwoWayPegData`) or an unrecorded manual
Thunder-side transaction (should never happen in a well-run pool).

### The public dashboard's per-worker page

At `/worker/:name` (no auth) — miner-facing — the same fundamentals
without the operator-only cross-checks. It shows recent shares,
hashrate estimates from the share stream, and blocks found by the
worker. If a miner asks "how much am I owed?", direct them to their
own row on the leaderboard for the numbers; direct them to the
`/admin/worker/:id` page if they want the audit trail (behind basic
auth, invite-only).

### SQL cookbook — reproduce any number from the DB

**Every share you've ever landed:**

```sql
SELECT id, datetime(ts,'unixepoch') AS ts_utc, difficulty, is_block, block_hash
FROM   shares
WHERE  worker_id = :wid
ORDER  BY ts DESC;
```

**Your all-time accrual, computed:**

```sql
SELECT SUM(CAST(difficulty * :rate AS INTEGER)) AS accrued
FROM   shares
WHERE  worker_id = :wid;
```

**Your accrual over an arbitrary window:**

```sql
SELECT SUM(CAST(difficulty * :rate AS INTEGER)) AS accrued
FROM   shares
WHERE  worker_id = :wid
  AND  ts BETWEEN :from_unix AND :to_unix;
```

**Who found the last block:**

```sql
SELECT height, hash, datetime(ts,'unixepoch') AS ts_utc, finder_id,
       finder_address, reward_sats
FROM   blocks_found
ORDER  BY ts DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Rejects, grouped by reason, last hour:**

```sql
SELECT reason, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM   rejects
WHERE  ts > strftime('%s','now','-1 hour')
GROUP  BY reason
ORDER  BY n DESC;
```

**Every deposit ever made:**

```sql
SELECT datetime(ts,'unixepoch') AS ts_utc, sats_deposited,
       fee_sats, thunder_recipient, btc_txid,
       ctip_seq_before, ctip_seq_after
FROM   deposits
ORDER  BY ts DESC;
```

## Common mismatches and what they mean

| symptom | likely cause | to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit page shows ⚠ | `POOL_PPS_SATS_PER_DIFF` env doesn't match `proxy.conf` | grep both, restart dashboard |
| accrued grows without shares | somebody wrote to `pps_credits` by hand | `.timeline` the DB; look for gaps in `shares.id` |
| paid_sats > sum of `deposits` | payout worker sending BTC-equivalent that never entered Thunder | reconcile via Thunder RPC's tx history |
| shares.is_block=1 but no `blocks_found` row | block was found but `submitblock` failed or is still in flight | grep pool log for `submitblock failed` |
| dashboard hashrate lower than the miner's own display | actual delivery is lower than the miner claims (thermal / net / firmware); nonce distribution is fine | see [OPERATOR_GUIDE.md](OPERATOR_GUIDE.md) troubleshooting |
| single share value looks tiny | vardiff pushed worker difficulty down; per-share reward compresses; but shares_per_minute is up so payout per minute stays the same | look at `Σ difficulty` per hour on the audit page — that number is invariant to vardiff |

## What the pool CANNOT audit

- **Whether a miner is actually delivering the hashes they claim.** If
  they underclock and send fewer shares, the pool sees fewer shares
  and credits accordingly. That's normal, not fraud. See the
  block-withholding audit in [payout/audit.js](payout/audit.js) for
  the statistical fraud detector — it flags workers whose observed
  block-find rate is significantly below expected.
- **What Thunder does with the deposit** once it's on the sidechain.
  We only see the enforcer's Ctip. Thunder-side crediting to
  individual sidechain addresses is Thunder's business; if a miner
  says "I never got the coins", verify via `thunder-cli
  get-transaction <txid>` on a Thunder node.
- **Whether the operator has actually deposited what they should
  have.** That's a business trust question, not a technical one. The
  `deposits` ledger is honest about what the operator DID; there's
  no consensus-level enforcement that says the operator MUST deposit
  by any particular date.

For those three, transparency is the only defense — that's what
this doc, the audit page, and the SQL cookbook above are for.
