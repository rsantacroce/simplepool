/* A payout is credited when it is MINED, not when it is sent.
 *
 * Two rules are being pinned here, and they pull in opposite directions.
 *
 * 1. At most one payout in flight. Thunder selects UTXOs without excluding
 *    those already spent by transactions in its own mempool, and a transfer
 *    consumes every wallet UTXO — returning the remainder as change that is
 *    unspendable until the tx is mined. So a second transfer picks the very
 *    inputs the first one spends and is rejected:
 *
 *        mempool error: can't add transaction, utxo double spent
 *
 *    Observed in production: one payout broadcast, then four failures every
 *    thirty seconds indefinitely, because nothing in the loop knew to wait.
 *
 * 2. `paid_sats` means settled. Crediting at broadcast made `accrued - paid`
 *    understate the pool's real liability for as long as settlement took —
 *    265 BTC for over four hours on drynet3 — and left no way back if the
 *    transaction never landed.
 *
 * The tension is in telling "confirmed" from "gone". Thunder's get_transaction
 * reports a block_hash only while the transaction is recent; after the
 * sidechain moves on, a long-confirmed txid reads back exactly like one that
 * never existed. Guessing eviction from that silence would re-queue a batch
 * that was already paid, so the loop refuses to guess — see the
 * 'cannot be determined' tests, which are the ones protecting real money.
