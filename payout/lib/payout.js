/* Payout loop.
 *
 * Each tick:
 *   1. settlePending() — if a batch is outstanding, ask whether it has been
 *      mined. Confirmed: credit it now (finalizeBatch). Still in the mempool:
 *      nudge Thunder to mine and stop, since its change is unspendable until
 *      then and there is nothing to pay from. Undeterminable: stop and shout.
 *   2. SELECT workers from pps_credits where (accrued - paid) >= minSats
 *      AND no in-flight payout row exists for them.
 *   3. Check the Thunder reserve covers the total plus one fee.
 *   4. Pay them ALL in a single transaction:
 *        a. beginBatch()                — INSERT one in-flight row per worker
 *        b. thunder.transferBatchDetailed() — one broadcast for the batch; on
 *                                         failure abortBatch() and retry next
 *                                         tick with paid_sats untouched
 *        c. attachBatchTxid()           — stamp the txid; the rows STAY in
 *                                         flight, and nobody is credited
 *                                         until step 1 of a later tick sees
 *                                         the transaction in a block
 *
 * Why credit on confirmation rather than on broadcast: `paid` is the pool's
 * record of a debt discharged, and a transaction sitting in a mempool has
 * discharged nothing. Crediting at broadcast made `accrued - paid` understate
 * the real liability for as long as settlement took — observed at 4h+ and
 * 265 BTC on drynet3 — and left no path back if the transaction never landed.
 *
 * Why one transaction rather than one per worker: Thunder only advances when
 * a mainchain block commits to it, and its wallet cannot spend unconfirmed
 * change — so N transactions cost N sidechain blocks, and the queue drains
 * slower than it fills as soon as the pool has more than a handful of miners.
 * Batching makes throughput independent of miner count.
 *
 * The cost is failure isolation: one bad address fails the whole batch rather
 * than just that worker. That is the right trade here — every recipient is a
 * Thunder address the proxy already validated at authorize time, and a batch
 * that fails leaves nobody credited and nobody stranded, so the next tick
 * simply retries. A persistently bad address surfaces as a repeating failure
 * in tx_attempts with the transaction attached.
 *
 * Crash semantics:
 *   - Crash between (a) and (b): rows stay with txid=''. listDue skips those
 *     workers, and listStuck() reports them, until an operator reconciles
 *     (was it broadcast? if yes attach the txid, if no delete the rows). This
 *     is the only genuinely ambiguous state, because a broadcast that
 *     happened is indistinguishable from one that did not.
 *   - Crash between (b) and (c): the same rows with the same remedy, and it
 *     is now a much narrower window — (c) is a local UPDATE, not a credit.
 *   - Crash after (c), before confirmation: nothing special. The rows carry
 *     their txid and the next start settles them normally; this is the
 *     ordinary resting state between a broadcast and a Thunder block.
 *   - Crash mid-finalize: the SQLite transaction commits or rolls back as a
 *     whole, across every worker in the batch. No partial credit. */

/* Has `txid` been mined?
 *
 * Thunder gives no single durable answer, so this asks two sources and
 * accepts only POSITIVE evidence from either:
 *
 *   1. get_transaction -> block_hash. Authoritative, but transient: once the
 *      sidechain advances past the block, the txid reads back as `null` —
 *      byte-identical to a txid that never existed. Verified in production:
 *      a payout reported its block_hash while it was the tip and became
 *      indistinguishable from nonexistent one block later.
 *
 *   2. The wallet UTXO set. Each UTXO records the outpoint that created it,
 *      and Thunder only admits confirmed UTXOs — a transfer's change is not
 *      spendable until mined, which is the whole reason payouts serialise.
 *      So an outpoint bearing our txid IS the confirmation, and it is durable:
 *      the change survives until the NEXT payout spends it, and that cannot
 *      happen until this one is finalized.
 *
 * Absence is never read as confirmation, and — just as important — never as
 * eviction. "The node has forgotten it" and "it confirmed a while ago" look
 * the same from here, so inferring eviction and re-queueing the batch would
 * pay it twice. Unknown means unknown; it blocks and asks for a human.

 *     same. So an outstanding batch is re-checked on `settleIntervalMs`.
 *
