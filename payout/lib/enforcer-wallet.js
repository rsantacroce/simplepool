/* L1 Bitcoin payout rail, for pool_mode = pplns-btc.
 *
 * The pool holds no keys and builds no transactions. The bip300301_enforcer
 * runs with --enable-wallet, the coinbase pays an address from that wallet
 * (WalletService/CreateNewAddress), and paying miners is one RPC:
 * WalletService/SendTransaction takes a destinations map and a fee rate and
 * does the selecting, signing and broadcasting itself.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this file is short. An earlier design had the pool
 * track its own coinbase outpoints, build a BIP174 PSBT, and hand it to the
 * operator to sign offline — several hundred lines of transaction
 * construction whose bugs would be silent and expensive. The enforcer already
 * owns a wallet, so none of that has to exist here.
 *
 * The interface deliberately mirrors ThunderClient's, so payout.js does not
 * care which rail it is driving: same at-most-once protocol, same
 * payouts_in_flight rows, same settle-on-confirm. Only the drain differs.
