# simplepool-payout

Thunder payout worker. Drains `pps_credits.accrued_sats - paid_sats` from
the shared SQLite database by issuing Thunder transactions on a cadence,
then writes back `paid_sats`.

Lives outside the C proxy so the hot path (block-template / share
acceptance) is never blocked on Thunder RPC latency. The C proxy is the
only writer of `accrued_sats`; this worker is the only writer of
`paid_sats`. SQLite WAL + a 5-second busy timeout keep them out of each
other's way.

## Run

```
PAYOUT_DB_PATH=../data/shares.db \
THUNDER_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6009 \
THUNDER_FROM_ADDRESS=<pool base58 thunder address> \
node index.js
```

Dry run — log what would be paid, skip Thunder RPC and DB writes:

```
PAYOUT_DRY_RUN=1 PAYOUT_DB_PATH=../data/shares.db \
  THUNDER_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6009 \
  THUNDER_FROM_ADDRESS=any \
  node index.js
```

## What it does each tick

1. **Settle** — if a batch is outstanding, ask Thunder whether it has been
   mined. Confirmed: credit every worker in it now. Still in the mempool:
   nudge Thunder to mine and stop for this tick. Undeterminable: stop and
   log loudly (see below).
2. `SELECT … FROM pps_credits JOIN workers WHERE accrued - paid >= min`,
   excluding anyone with an in-flight row
3. `thunder.balance()` — bail this tick if the reserve is short
4. **Broadcast** everyone due in ONE transaction, and stamp its txid onto
   their in-flight rows. Nobody is credited here.

Payouts *are* batched into a single transaction. Thunder advances only when
a mainchain block commits to it and cannot spend the change of an unconfirmed
transaction, so one tx per worker would cost one sidechain block each and the
queue would drain slower than it fills. The cost is failure isolation: one bad
address fails the whole batch. That is the right trade — every recipient is an
address the proxy validated at authorize time, and a failed batch credits
nobody and strands nobody.

## Three clocks, not one

Payouts run **once a day**. That is `PAYOUT_INTERVAL_MS`, and it is the only
cadence a miner ever sees: a single batched transaction every 24h paying
everyone over `PAYOUT_MIN_SATS`.

The daily interval deliberately does not govern what happens to a batch that
has already gone out, because two of the states a tick can end in are ruined
by a long wait:

| after a tick that… | next tick in | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| did nothing, or settled a batch cleanly | `PAYOUT_INTERVAL_MS` (24h) | the ordinary daily cadence |
| broadcast a batch, or is still waiting on one | `PAYOUT_SETTLE_INTERVAL_MS` (30s) | nobody in the batch is credited until a tick sees it in a Thunder block, and the stall-recovery nudge only fires from a tick |
| failed to broadcast, or found the reserve short | `PAYOUT_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` (5m) | nothing was sent and nobody was credited — the run did not happen, so it is retried rather than skipped to tomorrow |
| could not determine a settlement | `PAYOUT_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` (5m) | terminal until an operator reconciles; re-logging it every 30s for a day buries everything else |

`nextDelayMs()` in [lib/payout.js](lib/payout.js) is the whole decision, and
[test/cadence.test.js](test/cadence.test.js) pins each row of that table.

To force a run without waiting for the next one, use the dashboard's
**Trigger payout now** button (or `POST /payout/run` on the worker's admin
HTTP surface) — restarting the service also ticks immediately.

## `paid` means mined, not sent

`pps_credits.paid_sats` moves only when a transaction has been observed in a
block. A payout sitting in a mempool has discharged no debt, so counting it as
paid makes `accrued - paid` understate what the pool actually owes — measured
at 265 BTC for over four hours on drynet3 — and leaves no way back if the
transaction never lands.

Telling "confirmed" from "gone" is the hard part, because Thunder offers no
single durable answer. Two sources are consulted and only **positive**
evidence from either is accepted:

- `get_transaction` → `block_hash`. Authoritative but transient: once the
  sidechain moves past the block, a long-confirmed txid reads back as `null`,
  byte-identical to one that never existed.
- The **wallet UTXO set**, where each UTXO records the outpoint that created
  it. Thunder admits only confirmed UTXOs, so an outpoint bearing our txid is
  itself the confirmation — and it is durable, because that change output
  survives until the next payout spends it, which cannot happen until this one
  is finalized.

Silence is never read as confirmation, and never as eviction either. Inferring
"it must have been dropped" from a forgotten txid would re-queue a batch that
had already been paid.

## Nudging Thunder

Thunder advances only when a mainchain block commits to it, and nothing
schedules that — so without help a broadcast payout waits for a human to press
a button, and the whole queue waits behind it. The loop calls Thunder's `mine`
in exactly two places, and **when** it fires matters as much as that it does.

### Once per broadcast, not once per tick

`mine` builds a block body from the mempool *before* it takes the miner lock,
then parks that snapshot as its BMM request the moment the lock frees:

```rust
let body = types::Body::new(Vec::new(), coinbase);   // mempool snapshot HERE
let mut miner_write = miner.write().await;           // then block on the lock
miner_write.attempt_bmm(bribe.to_sat(), 0, header, body)
```

So a nudge issued *while waiting* captures a mempool that predates the next
batch, queues behind the in-flight `mine`, and becomes the parked request the
instant the current batch confirms. The next batch — broadcast seconds later —
cannot be in the block that request produces, so it waits for the one after.
Every payout then costs two sidechain blocks instead of one.

Measured on drynet3 before this was fixed: Thunder parked its request 14–93s
*ahead* of the broadcast it was meant to carry in 7 of 7 cycles, and 42 Thunder
blocks produced only 25 settlements.

The loop therefore nudges:

- **right after a broadcast**, so the snapshot contains the batch just sent.
  Never rate-limited — it is already bounded by the settlement cadence.
- **to break a stall**, once a batch has sat unconfirmed for
  `PAYOUT_NUDGE_STALL_SEC` (default 300s), which means its request was not
  carried and nothing will re-park. Rate-limited by
  `PAYOUT_NUDGE_INTERVAL_MS`.

Do not lower `PAYOUT_NUDGE_STALL_SEC` towards the tick interval — that
reintroduces the stale-snapshot problem the split exists to avoid.

It fires only while something is genuinely waiting to settle, so an idle pool
spends no BMM bids on empty blocks. A failed nudge never fails the tick.

## At-most-once payout protocol

1. `INSERT INTO payouts_in_flight (worker_id, sats, txid='')` — one row per
   worker, before Thunder is touched. `listDue()` skips any worker with an
   in-flight row.
2. `transferBatchDetailed(recipients, fee)` — broadcast. Three RPCs under the
   hood (`create_transfer` → `sign_transaction` → `submit_transaction`); only
   the last can put a tx on the network. On clean failure (an error before a
   txid is returned) the rows are DELETEd and the workers are eligible next
   tick.
3. `attachBatchTxid()` — stamp the txid. The rows **stay** in flight.
4. On a later tick, once the transaction is confirmed: in ONE SQLite
   transaction across the whole batch, `paid_sats += sats`, append to
   `payouts`, DELETE the in-flight rows.

Crash semantics:

| crash point | row state | action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| after (1), before (2) | `txid=''` | manual: did the broadcast happen? |
| after (2), before (3) | `txid=''` | manual: same question, narrower window |
| after (3), before (4) | `txid` set | none — this is the ordinary waiting state |
| inside (4) | atomic across the batch — fully applied or fully rolled back | none |

`reportStuck()` logs in-flight rows older than 5 minutes **that have no
txid**. Rows with a txid are routinely hours old — Thunder produces only a
handful of blocks a day — and reporting them would bury the one row that
actually needs a human.

### Reconciling by hand

Two situations need an operator. Neither is auto-resolved, because both turn
on a question only a human can answer: *did this transaction make it onto the
sidechain?*

**A row with no txid.** The worker died around the broadcast, so it is unknown
whether anything went out. Check the Thunder node, then:

```sh
# the tx is live or mined — adopt it, and the normal settle path takes over
sqlite3 data/shares.db "UPDATE payouts_in_flight SET txid = '<txid>' WHERE id = <id>;"

# it never went out — release the workers to be paid again next tick
sqlite3 data/shares.db "DELETE FROM payouts_in_flight WHERE id = <id>;"
```

**`CANNOT DETERMINE settlement`.** The loop can see neither the transaction
nor any wallet UTXO from it, so it has halted payouts rather than guess.
Establish the truth first — the recipients' balances are the ground truth:

```sh
CLI=…/thunder_app_cli
sudo -u forknet $CLI get-transaction <txid>      # non-null = still in mempool
sudo -u forknet $CLI get-wallet-utxos | grep <txid>
```

If it was mined, finalize the batch by hand (all rows sharing the txid, in one
transaction). If it truly never landed, `DELETE` those rows and the workers are
paid again on the next tick. Do not delete rows you have not positively shown
to be unmined — that is how a batch gets paid twice.

## Block-withholding audit (`audit.js`)

PPS-specific fraud check. A worker can submit valid shares to collect
PPS payouts and then quietly *not submit* the ones that would be
blocks, keeping the on-chain reward off-pool. Detection is statistical:
each worker's accrued share difficulty as a fraction of the pool's
total predicts what fraction of blocks they should have found.

```
PAYOUT_DB_PATH=../data/shares.db node audit.js
PAYOUT_DB_PATH=../data/shares.db node audit.js --window-hours 168
PAYOUT_DB_PATH=../data/shares.db node audit.js --json    # for cron / slack
```

For each worker over the window:
- **expected_blocks** = `pool_blocks * (worker_accrued / pool_accrued)`
- **actual_blocks**   = blocks they actually found
- **z**               = `(expected - actual) / sqrt(expected)`

A worker is flagged `suspicious` when:
- `expected_blocks >= 5` (below this, randomness dominates), AND
- `z >= 3` (≈1-in-740 false-positive rate under honest mining)

Run on a cron and pipe the `--json` output to your alert sink of choice.
The audit reads the DB only — safe to run while the proxy is writing.

## Known gaps (deliberate)

- **Flat 100-sat fee.** Will need a smarter fee model once Thunder
  fee dynamics are observable. Currently hardcoded in `lib/payout.js`.
- **No confirmation tracking.** Thunder's RPC doesn't expose per-tx
  confirmation counts; we treat a successful broadcast as final.
  That's how the rest of Thunder tooling works today.
- **Manual reconciliation.** Crashes between broadcast and finalize
  need an operator. The alternative (auto-reconcile via Thunder
  mempool/chain lookup) is fragile without a getrawtransaction-style
  endpoint and is left as a follow-up.
