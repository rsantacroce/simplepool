-- block's payouts. If this file were deleted nobody would be owed a payment,
-- because nobody was ever holding one -- the pool would simply forget whose
-- turn it was.
--
-- Recorded as a fraction rather than in difficulty units on purpose. Shares
-- stay in the window across several blocks, so rolling unpaid difficulty
