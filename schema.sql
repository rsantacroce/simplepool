 * `polls` and `last_seen`, so each row is the *span* over which one template

 * dictated the coinbase (BIP22 "coinbasetxn"), which is how the mandatory
 * BIP300/301 commitments reach the block; 'bitcoind' means the pool built its
 * own coinbase and the block carries none. `cb_op_returns` makes that concrete:
