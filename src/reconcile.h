/* The block confirmation pass, and the PPLNS distribution that hangs off it.
 *
 * Lifted out of main.c to be linkable without it. main.c has main(), so
 * nothing in it can be reached from a test binary, and this is the code least
 * able to afford that: both of the worst bugs in the pplns work lived here and
 * both were caught by a three-minute regtest run because there was no faster
 * way to catch them.
 *
 *   - the pass only ran when the tip jumped two or more blocks, because it
 *     compared the new tip against the previous TEMPLATE height (tip + 1). On
 *     an ordinary one-block advance it never ran at all, so blocks stayed
 *     'pending' forever and pplns credited nobody.
 *   - distribution sat behind an early return taken whenever the backend
 *     served getblockhash. That state latches for the life of the process, so
 *     a pool on an ordinary bitcoind confirmed its blocks, counted them past
 *     maturity, and then never distributed one. Nothing looked wrong: only
 *     pps_credits stayed empty.
 *
 * Both are decisions about which of two confirmation mechanisms runs and what
 * still has to happen afterwards — no network needed to test either, once the
 * one call that does need a network is injectable. That is what block_hash_fn
 * is for.
