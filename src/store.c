     * guards the ring buffer and is released before commit_batch() runs, and
     * node_tip_mu guards a single statement. So two transactions could
     * overlap, and BEGIN IMMEDIATE simply failed for the loser -- a race, so
     * it showed up as an occasional lost write rather than anything
     * reproducible.
     *
     * Savepoints look like the fix and are worse. A savepoint nests into
     * whatever is already open, which on this connection is usually the
     * commit thread's share batch -- so RELEASE does not commit the write (a
     * failed batch discards it after its caller was told it succeeded), and
     * ROLLBACK TO rewinds the connection past the caller's own boundary,
     * taking the commit thread's shares with it. Verified both in plain
     * sqlite; see the tests. That trades a lost payout-queue row for lost
     * SHARES, which is what every window is measured from.
     *
     * Serialising is what these writes actually need. A stratum-path write
     * waits for at most one batch, bounded by commit_window_ms. Not recursive:
     * nothing reachable from commit_batch() opens one of these transactions,
