/* Stratum V1 server: TCP listener + thread-per-connection.
 *
 * Wire format: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0. Methods handled:
 *   mining.subscribe, mining.authorize, mining.submit
 *
 * Concurrency: an rwlock guards `current_job`. set_job swaps the pointer
 * under a write lock and pushes the previous job into a small ring of
 * "recent jobs" kept alive ~60s for late submits. Connection threads take
 * read locks for notify/submit lookups.
 *
 * Jobs are reference counted. Anything that reads a job only while holding
 * the lock that guards its slot (send_current_notify, current_net_diff) needs
 * nothing more; find_job hands out a counted reference because a submit
 * outlives the lock, and the tip watcher frees jobs from under it otherwise.
 *
 * Vardiff adjusts each connection's difficulty toward cfg.vardiff_target_spm
 * shares/minute, clamped so the share target never exceeds the network
 * target (see vardiff_maybe_retarget).

 *
 *   - The ceiling exists because the miner filters locally at whatever we
 *     assign. A share target harder than the network target means the miner
 *     throws away valid blocks before we ever see them.
 *   - The floor exists because a marketplace aggregates a whole fleet behind

 *     both measure what they were actually handed. A port that promises a
 *     floor and quietly serves less has its order cancelled.
 *
 * The listener commit chose the ceiling and reported the mismatch — a health
 * check naming both numbers. Reporting is necessary but it is not sufficient:
 * the marketplace is not reading our dashboard, it is measuring the
 * difficulty on the wire. So where a port states a floor, that floor is now
 * kept.
 *
 * Which is affordable precisely because the floor is per-port and opt-in. A
 * listener that never said min_diff carries none, so `listen_port` and every
 * regtest and forknet config behave exactly as they did — ceiling wins, no
 * floor, no blocks discarded. Only a port explicitly sold as a rental port
 * makes the trade, and on that port the trade is the point: above the

 * the cost of being reachable by the fleet at all. main.c warns at startup

 *
 * Conservative algorithm:
 *   ratio = observed_spm / target_spm
 *   if  ratio in [0.5, 2.0] → leave it (avoid jitter)
 *   else                    → new_diff = old_diff * ratio, clamped
 *
 * The rate loop alone cannot correct a miner that enforces its own local
 * difficulty floor above the difficulty we assigned it. Below that floor the
 * miner's submission rate does not depend on our difficulty at all — it
 * submits whatever beats its own target — so the loop has no gradient to
 * follow, and any share rate that happens to land inside the deadband is a
 * fixed point. A miner floored at 256 while assigned 1 therefore sits at 1
 * forever, and since a share is credited at the difficulty we assigned
 * (share_diff = c->difficulty in handle_submit), the pool books 1/256th of
 * the work it actually received: a hashrate estimate 256x low, and on a
 * pps-classic pool a payout 256x short.
 *
 * So alongside the rate loop, watch the difficulty the shares actually
 * achieve. Every share in the window achieving far more than we asked for is
 * a direct measurement of that floor, with none of the rate loop's
 * ambiguity, so raise the assigned difficulty to just under it.
 *
 * Aim just under the observed minimum — but only just, because the two ways
 * of missing the floor are not symmetric. Land above it and the accounting
 * stays exact: the miner keeps submitting everything that beats its own
 * floor, the pool accepts the fraction that also beats the assigned
 * difficulty, and crediting each of those at the assigned value books exactly
 * the work performed. Land below it and every share is accepted but credited
 * at less than it achieved, which is the under-crediting this whole check
 * exists to remove, just at a smaller factor. Overshooting costs the miner
 * rejected submissions; undershooting costs it money.
 *
 * So a small backoff, not a generous one. The observed minimum already sits
 * above the floor — a share clearing floor D achieves D/u for u uniform on
 * (0,1], so the smallest of n of them lands near D*(n+1)/n — which is what
 * leaves the result hovering around the floor instead of well under it.
 * Correcting that overshoot away would center the estimate and, by the
 * asymmetry above, credit worse.
 *
 * VD_FLOOR_TRIGGER is what stops this from ratcheting. Assigning above the
 * floor does raise the next window's observed minimum, but the next retarget
 * only fires if that minimum still clears four times the assigned difficulty,
 * which after a correct jump it does not. It is also what a well-matched
 * miner has to clear on every share in a window to trip this by chance, which
 * at five shares is about one window in thirty thousand — and costs it only a
 * difficulty briefly set too high, which the rate loop then walks back down
 * and which credits it correctly meanwhile.
 *
 * Note this deliberately does not count rejected submissions toward the
 * window. A stale or unknown-job reject is not work at the assigned
 * difficulty, and a low-difficulty reject is by definition work that missed
 * it; feeding either into the rate would push the difficulty up on miners
 * whose real problem is job latency.
 *
 * Always emits a single mining.set_difficulty when diff changes. The
 * client picks it up for the next job notify; we don't force a re-notify
 * because every job already carries the difficulty it went out under
 * (conn_record_job_difficulty), so shares for jobs the miner already holds
 * stay acceptable at that difficulty for as long as the job itself lives. */
