/* The extranonce split, advertised on mining.subscribe and baked into every
 * per-connection coinbase.
 *
 * extranonce1 is the pool's per-connection identifier; it must be unique
 * across live connections or two miners render identical coinbases (see
 * handle_subscribe). extranonce2 is the miner's private search field: it
 * owns those bytes and sweeps them freely.
 *
 * extranonce2 is 8 bytes rather than the classic 4. Raw search space is not
 * the reason -- 4 bytes already gives one connection 2^80 headers per job,
 * which no hashrate exhausts. The reason is subdivision: a stratum proxy in
 * front of the pool carves extranonce2 into a downstream-miner id (high
 * bytes) plus the downstream miner's own extranonce2 (low bytes). At 4 bytes
 * a proxy spending 3 on addressing leaves its miners a single byte, which
 * some firmware refuses to run with. At 8 it can spend 3 and still hand down
 * the conventional 4, so downstream miners see an ordinary pool.
 *
 * Widening these is a consensus-relevant change, not a cosmetic one: cb1
 * carries the scriptSig length varint computed from en1_size + en2_size, so
 * a submitted extranonce2 of any other length yields a coinbase whose
 * declared scriptSig length disagrees with its contents. handle_submit
 * rejects on length for exactly that reason. Keep the coinbase scriptSig
 * (BIP34 height push + coinbase_tag + en1 + en2) within 100 bytes. */
