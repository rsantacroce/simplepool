# What this covers that the unit tests cannot.
#
# tests/test_store.c proves store_pplns_distribute splits a window
# correctly, given a database somebody hand-built to have a matured block
# in it. Nothing proved that a real pool ever reaches that state: that a
# block found through stratum gets a window snapshotted onto its row, that
# the confirmation pass keeps counting its depth until it reaches 100, and
# that the distributor then actually runs and credits somebody. Every one
# of those is a different file, and the seam between them is where a mode
# that passes its unit tests still pays nobody.
#
# Both rails run, because pool_mode decides two things at once and only one
# of them is the rail. pplns-thunder and pplns-btc pool the reward
# identically and share every line of the distribution path; what differs
# is what a stratum username IS -- a Thunder address on one, a Bitcoin
# address on the other. So each rail authorizes with its own username shape
# against its own pool, and both must reach the same credited ledger. A
# regression that broke username validation for one rail would otherwise
# hide behind the other passing.
#
# The maturity gate is asserted as an absence before it is asserted as a
# presence. A confirmed-but-shallow block must credit NOBODY: crediting a
# coinbase before it is spendable creates a balance the pool cannot fund,
# which is the reserve requirement PPLNS exists to remove. Asserting only
# the end state would pass just as well against a distributor with no
# maturity check at all, which is the exact bug worth catching.
#
# Deterministic by construction: a fresh chain and a fresh database every
# run, its own data dir, and per-run ports, so it coexists with a dev stack
# in .regtest/ and with the other two e2e suites.
#
# Env:
#   REGTEST_DIR      data dir, WIPED each run (default: <repo>/.regtest-pplns)
