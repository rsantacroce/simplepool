#
# The other two pplns rails credit pps_credits and hand the money to a payout
# worker ~100 blocks later. This one has no ledger step at all: the payment IS
# the block. So what has to be proved is different, and only the chain can
# prove it —
#
#   1. the pool starts and mines with NO pool_btc_address configured. There is
#      no pool wallet in this mode; if one were needed the config would have
#      refused it, and if the coinbase quietly paid one anyway the assertions
#      below would find it.
#   2. the mined block's coinbase pays the miners in the window, read out of
#      the chain rather than out of anything simplepool wrote.
#   3. NO output pays an address the pool controls. That is the whole claim of
#      the mode and it is the one thing a bookkeeping bug cannot fake.
#   4. NOTHING is owed off-chain, ever. pps_credits must be empty: this mode
#      writes no ledger row at all, so a row of any size means some other
#      rail's code path ran.
#   5. the policy is stated in the log. A claim below the payout floor earns
#      that miner nothing from that block — its value goes to the miners the
#      coinbase could pay — which is a trap unless the operator can see it, so
#      the disclosure lines are asserted here exactly like the money is.
#   6. a MIXED window really does redistribute, on chain. Claims of
#      100 : 10 : 1 with a floor between the last two: the first two are paid
#      in the coinbase, the third gets no output, and its satoshis turn up
#      spread across the first two -- NOT on the operator's output, which
#      holds its fee to the satoshi. The block also records whose turn was
#      skipped, in a queue that sums to zero.
#
# That last stage is the one this file could not do for a long time, and the
# reason is worth writing down. Share difficulty is clamped to network
# difficulty on regtest, so a 2.0x window holds about two shares -- every
# other stage here reports "window of 1 miner(s)". A mixed window needs a much
# wider multiple AND a share history, so it seeds the shares table directly
# with the pool STOPPED. That is replaying the pool's own record of accepted
# work, not stubbing the thing under test: the window query, the split, the
# builder, the block and the outputs read back off the chain are all real.
#
# An earlier version of this file had a stage that squeezed the byte budget
# and printed how much had carried. It printed 0 every time and passed
# regardless, which is worse than no stage at all. This one asserts the
# amounts: 1 share in 111 of the payable reward moving to the other two
# miners, and the operator holding its fee to the satoshi and nothing more.
#
# What it CANNOT reach: a window whose dropped claim is not the LAST entry.
# Order is largest-first until somebody is owed a turn, so a fresh pool always
# drops the tail, and any reading of the paid set as "the first N payees" is
# right by coincidence here. The non-tail case — a reserved small claim placed
# FIRST and then dropped by the floor — is exercised in tests/test_stratum.c
# (test_the_queue_credits_the_miners_the_block_actually_skipped), which is
# where that bug was caught.
