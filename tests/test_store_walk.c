/* White-box test for the PPLNS boundary walk in store_pplns_window().
 *
 * What is being pinned: when the walk cannot PROVE it covered the window, the
 * function must return an error, never a window. The caller renders whatever
 * it returns into a coinbase and publishes it; the payment IS the block, so a
 * wrong window is mined, irreversible, and invisible afterwards.
 *
 * HOW the failure is reproduced. The interesting failures are a sqlite step
 * that fails PART WAY THROUGH the widening loop -- BUSY from the share writer
 * committing under WAL, INTERRUPT, NOMEM. Two things rule out the obvious
 * approaches: sqlite3_progress_handler fires for the store's background commit
 * thread on the same connection, so it cannot single out one statement; and an
 * authorizer runs at prepare time, before the loop. So this file includes
 * store.c as source with sqlite3_step redirected to a wrapper that fails the
 * boundary query on demand, and nothing else. That keeps the fault injection
 * inside the test binary -- production code carries no test seam. */
