# Changelog

Notable changes per release. The newest version is first; each section is what
the release workflow publishes as that release's notes, above the install
boilerplate.

Anything that changes what a miner is paid, or what an operator has to tell
their miners, is called out explicitly — those are the changes that cost
somebody money if they go unread.

## Unreleased

### Operators: the dashboard now listens on loopback by default

`dashboard/server.js` binds `DASHBOARD_BIND`, default `127.0.0.1`, where it
used to bind every interface. Behind nginx nothing changes. **If you reach the
dashboard directly on `:8081`, add `Environment=DASHBOARD_BIND=0.0.0.0` to its
systemd drop-in before upgrading**, or it stops answering there. `install.sh`
sets it for you: loopback with nginx, all interfaces with `--no-nginx`. The
Docker image sets `0.0.0.0` inside the container.

### Miners on pplns-thunder / pplns-btc: small blocks are no longer short-changed

When a block's operator fee came to less than the 546-sat dust limit, the
coinbase (correctly) paid no fee output and the pool wallet received the whole
reward — but the distributor still took `fee_bps` off before crediting miners,
so the difference sat in the pool wallet credited to nobody. The distributor
now applies the coinbase's dust rule. Only blocks worth less than roughly
`546 × 10000 / fee_bps` sats are affected (54,600 sats at 1%).

### Config: an eighth `listener` line is refused

The server has room for `listen_port` plus seven extra ports. An eighth
`listener` used to load cleanly and then silently not be bound; it is now a
config error naming the limit.

### Smaller fixes

- `install.sh --help` no longer claims `--pps-sats-per-diff` defaults to 1000
  — it defaults to unset (derived per template) — and the installer warns if
  you pass it.
- `schema.sql` documents the unique index on `blocks_found(hash)` that the
  proxy creates at startup, and why it is not created there.
- `docs/simplepool.html` is now a full reference: every config key and
  environment variable, the stratum protocol, the coinbase layout, every API,
  the schema and the hard limits.

## 0.4.0 — three PPLNS modes, and coinbase-direct payouts

The headline is that a pool no longer has to hold miners' money to run PPLNS.

### Three new pool modes

`pool_mode` gains `pplns-thunder`, `pplns-btc` and `pplns-coinbase`, alongside
the existing `solo` and `pps-classic`. All five are documented in
[README](README.md#the-five-modes), with a sequence diagram each in
[docs/simplepool.html](docs/simplepool.html).

PPLNS divides a block among the shares that produced it, so **the pool never
owes more than it has just been paid**. There is no operator reserve to fund
and operator ruin is not a failure mode — the trade is that miners carry the
variance, which is why the fee is normally set lower than on PPS.

- **`pplns-thunder`** settles over Thunder, reusing the existing payout worker.
- **`pplns-btc`** settles on Bitcoin L1 through the enforcer's own wallet.
  Needs `bip300301_enforcer --enable-wallet` and `PAYOUT_RAIL=btc`.
- **`pplns-coinbase`** settles in the block itself.

### `pplns-coinbase`: the pool never receives the reward

The block's own coinbase pays the entire window, one output per miner. No pool
wallet, no payout worker, no ledger row, no maturity wait. A reorged block
simply never paid, so there is nothing to claw back.

**What operators must tell their miners.** A coinbase has a fixed budget of
bytes, so one block cannot pay everyone in a large window. Two limits decide
who it pays — `coinbase_max_bytes` (default 1000) and
`pplns_payout_floor_sats` (default 546, the dust limit).

A claim that clears neither is **shared out among the miners that block could
pay** — never the operator, who takes only its fee at every byte budget. The
skipped miner then goes **first in the queue** for the next block: a quarter of
every coinbase's payout slots are reserved for whoever has waited longest.

So being a small miner here costs **frequency, not money**. That is the single
sentence to put on a pool page, and the proxy states the floor at startup, per
template, per block, and on the dashboard before a miner connects.

The queue lives in `pplns_fractions`: a signed fraction of one block reward per
worker, summing to zero. **It is not a balance and the pool holds nothing
against it** — delete the table and nobody is owed a payment, the pool only
forgets whose turn it was. Rows are staged when a block is found and applied
only once it confirms, so an orphaned block rotates nobody.

`coinbase_max_bytes` is settable **per listener**, and usually should be: the
ceiling is a marketplace rule that binds only on the port rented hashrate
connects to, and every byte of it costs a payout.

```
coinbase_max_bytes = 3000
listener = port=3335 label=rental min_diff=500000 initial_diff=500000 max_coinbase_bytes=900
```

### Safety

- **The window walk is bounded.** Reading the PPLNS window used to re-scan the
  entire `shares` table on every template — 250 ms per million rows, on the
  template thread. It now walks back in bounded batches: flat in history size
  rather than linear (8 M rows: 1033 ms → 1.08 ms).
- **A walk that cannot prove it covered the window returns an error**, and the
  pool publishes no job rather than a wrong one. Miners keep working the last
  job until it recovers. In this mode a wrong window is mined into a coinbase
  and published, so there is no later pass that could notice.
- **The payout-slot estimate charges each address what it costs.** It decides
  how many slots are reserved for long-waiting miners; assuming a fixed 31
  bytes was over by 24 slots on a window of taproot addresses at a 3000-byte
  budget, reserving a third of the coinbase where a quarter was meant. Now
  within 2 slots across every budget and address type tested, and never over.
- **Store transactions are serialised.** The store shares one SQLite connection
  across three threads and nothing guarded it: `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` failed
  outright when another was mid-transaction, dropping the write with only a
  warning. `store_pplns_distribute` was affected too, surviving on being
  retried each tip. A single mutex is now held across each transaction, so a
  write waits for at most one batch instead of losing to it.

### Dashboard

- Every mode gets its own guidance on the "About the numbers" card. Previously
  all three PPLNS modes fell through to *"this pool has not published its mode
  yet"*, directly beneath a header that named the mode correctly.
- Three places answered "not `pps-classic`" with the word *solo*: the worker
  page's **Owed** field, the "About the numbers" card, and the
  `pps_difficulty` health check.
- The templates page's **PPS rate** row was the fourth, and this bullet used
  to claim it fixed. It answered a zero rate with *"only pps-classic prices a
  share on arrival"* — a true sentence about a mode the pool is not in, on the
  page an operator opens when something looks wrong. It now names the pool's
  own mode, and for the PPLNS rails says where the price does come from: the
  block value above it is what gets divided, among the window, when a block is
  found. The label stops calling itself a PPS rate on a pool that has none,
  and the history table drops the rate column when no row was ever priced.
- **"The proxy may not be reaching its backend" was reading the wrong clock.**
  The templates page measured staleness from `ts` — when a template was first
  seen — which stopped advancing once repeat polls began folding into the row
  they match. From then on it reported chain speed as a proxy fault: on a
  chain averaging ~30 minutes a block against a 10-minute target, the 900 s
  threshold fired on roughly every second block, permanently, while the
  backend was in fact being polled every 30 seconds. It now measures from
  `last_seen`, which is the column that tracks backend contact, and the
  threshold follows the cadence the row was actually polled at — six missed
  polls, never sooner than two minutes — so a pool with a deliberately slow
  `bitcoind_poll_interval_ms` is not accused of being unreachable either. How
  long the chain has stood on one tip is still shown, as the plain fact it is
  rather than in the error colour.
- **Pool solvency** counted `blocks_found.reward_sats` as pool revenue in
  `pplns-coinbase`, where that is what the block paid the *miners* — reporting
  a healthy margin for a pool that holds nothing. Now skipped, with the reason.
- The connect card now says **which port to point which miner at**. Every
  published port is listed as a dialable URL with the difficulty behind it and
  who it is for, because a stratum URL says nothing about either and a rented
  fleet on the home-miner port is one connection submitting hundreds of
  thousands of shares a second — the pool limits it and the marketplace
  cancels the order for work the pool appears to be rejecting.
- **What a held floor costs is now disclosed to the miner paying for it.** A
  port holding difficulty 500 000 over a chain at 1 200 makes its miners
  discard roughly 416 of every 417 blocks they solve, since a miner filters
  locally at the difficulty it was assigned. That arithmetic was already in
  the operator's *"Stratum ports can hold their difficulty"* health check;
  nobody mining on the port ever saw it.

### Testing

One end-to-end regtest suite per mode, all in CI, each mining a real chain —
including `solo`, which had none anywhere despite being the default. See
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

### Upgrading from 0.3.0

Nothing is required: `solo` and `pps-classic` are unchanged, and the new
`pool_meta` and `pplns_*` tables are created on open. To adopt a PPLNS mode,
set `pool_mode` and read that mode's section in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) — `pplns-coinbase` in particular refuses
`pool_btc_address`, because it has no pool wallet at all.
